			 <p>Today I watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jason Howell&rsquo;s video overview of the new Pixel 9 phone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Rather than being an opinionated review, this overview does a good job of showing the features of the new phone, and I particularly like the walkthru Jason does of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the AI features<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>You see a good demonstration of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the dialog a user can have with Gemini Live<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it&rsquo;s impressive if not a little creepy. You also see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how Add Me works<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the resulting photos Jason show looks a bit obvious to me that they were &ldquo;edited.&rdquo; The use case for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the screenshots/OCR/AI Pixel feature<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of the Google Pixel 9 series sounds like how I use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->archivebox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to capture and save web pages that have information that I may need to reference in the future. I probably will use the screenshots feature, but I honestly don&rsquo;t know whether any of them are attractive/useful enough to compel me to buy the Pixel 9 in order to use them.</p>

			 <p>Because of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google #TeamPixel kerfuffle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this past week, I had great interest in reading the reviews of the Pixel 9 series posted by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->9to5Google<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Verge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wired<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The gist of the kerfuffle is, can one trust reviews when associated with a &ldquo;#GiftFromGoogle&rdquo; tag in light of leaked text of the latest agreement with influencers that sets an expectation that non-Google devices are not &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; over Google devices? Google&rsquo;s later clarification is, they don&rsquo;t consider #TeamPixel as a reviewers program, and I think implied in that statement is an expectation that participating influencers are influencing on behalf of the brand. I personally wonder why anyone thinks this is news, it should be obvious that brands, Google or any other, see influencers as extension of their marketing. What is an influencer anyway?</p>
<p>Back to the original question about trust, I think a related question is about value. When I read official reviews I can&rsquo;t help but feel the writers feel obligated to write something, anything, negative about the product being reviewed, which makes some sense because what product is perfect. Except, is what one writer think a negative really a negative? I think what you see in &ldquo;tech reviews&rdquo; invariably amount to biases. What happens is that products are reviewed against a writers preferences and not against some form of industry, or even publication, standard.</p>
<p>So, I think one needs to take tech reviews with a grain of salt. Tech reviewers of &ldquo;recognized&rdquo; publications are not necessarily any better or ethical than influencers. Many reviewers put high value in access to products and people of these companies. Like nearly every other piece of journalism, reviews are a mashup of facts and opinions otherwise the reviews would be nothing more than a print out of product specifications. At one time, publications like PC Magazine had labs to do performance testing and published the results against an established baseline and their reviews tended to provide explanation of what the deviations from the baseline mean. Of course opinions crept in to the explanations, they weren&rsquo;t nearly 100% opinions. Most tech reviews you read today are not a report of a product measured against a baseline, but rather a report of a person&rsquo;s experience about using the device and whether that experience met their expectations. (More like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chaos Manor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and less like Byte Labs) The value of these reviews then depend on the degree to which the reader and the writer&rsquo;s expectations align.</p>

			 <p>I am a lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs and feel blessed to have lived long enough to see them win the 2016 World Series. The players on that 2016 Cubs team will always be special and so when it came time for those players to part ways from the team I, like many, were disappointed, but I now have to admit they were the right decisions.</p>
<p>Last night Javier Baez, one of those on that 2016 who now plays for the Detroit Tigers, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->returned to Wrigley Field<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the first time since he was traded to the New York Mets. Even when Baez played for the Cubs he was not considered a good hitter, he chased most pitches out of the strike zone, but some time had the good fortune of making a big hit. I always felt Baez&rsquo;s value was most defined by his fielding at shortstop, and in his prime I thought him the best shortstop in baseball. I am old enough to remember that the shortstop position was not usually fielded by the best hitters (remember Shawn Dunston?), but considered the most important in field position and Baez fit that mold.</p>
<p>Even though I did not like the fact that the Cubs seemingly unceremoniously dumped those players from the 2016 roster, I have to admit that looking back now nearly all were the right decisions, except for one, the first one letting Kyle Schwarber go as he went on to win another Word Series with the Nationals and play in another with the Phillies.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kris Bryant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has not played a full season since he was traded to San Francisco. Anthony Rizzo has been alright but <!-- raw HTML omitted -->often injured<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with the Yankeess. Baez has never figured out the plate. It&rsquo;s clear to me now that even if they had kept these players the Cubs would not be any better of a team than they are today.</p>
<p>So, the front office was right in letting these players go for as many prospects they could get. Some, like Pete Crow-Armstrong, who they got in the trade to the Mets for Baez, has potential to be stars in their own right. My fear though is that the current Cubs front office has a profile for  players that seem to be one hit wonders over long term producers. In short, the new guys they get are like the old guys they had and that seems to produce the same results of not being good, nor clutch, hitters. You combine this hitting profile with a tendency turn over the bullpen every single off season and you get the mediocrity that is the current adjective for the Chicago Cubs.</p>

			 <p>I did not know that weather radar decreases detecting events like tornados and lake effect snow, which typically are below 4,500 feet,  at about 60 miles. The beam of the radar leaves at a half degree angle and that increases the further it gets away from the radar so that at 120 miles the beam is at 12,000 feet up in the atmosphere. To increase the effectiveness there needs to be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more weather radars deployed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The National Weather Service has four radars in Michigan (Pontiac, Grand Rapids, Gaylord, and Marquette), which if you use Radar Scope they are prefixed by the letter K.

			 <p>Thinking about the debate between AI and photography. I&rsquo;ve heard the question, &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->what is a photo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->?&rdquo; being raised, implying the definition of a photo as a graphical capture of a real moment is in danger. The introduction of AI tools that allow one to alter photos from something that really &ldquo;happened&rdquo; to something that didn&rsquo;t is what is being considered a problem. Except, what about how Photoshop has been used all these years? Presumably, people see editing a photo to improve it is different, but that editing can turn into a photo of something that did not happen. What about Google&rsquo;s Magic Eraser?</p>
<p>Perhaps there ought to be a definition of what is produced when one uses AI to alter a photo. I would suggest calling them composed pictures. In my mind a photo that is &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->re-imagined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; into something else is more like a painting than a photo and I think I would refer to them as something other than a photo. I think we are seeing the development of a new art form, the ability to craft the right words to generate a picture.</p>
<p>While I personally would never present a &ldquo;re-imagined&rdquo; picture as a photo, I think there needs to be at least a best practice where these AI tools include some type of watermark indicating they were produced by AI. The whole idea of discerning that which is real (news, photos, videos) and that which is fake is a problem because humans are lazy. I personally want to trust people and think living in a world in which everything has to be verified is exhausting.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Long elections<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are all about money, pure and simple. Hopefully one of the lessons to be learned from this upcoming U.S. Presidential election is that they don&rsquo;t have to be so long. We really need election reform in the U.S. that is intended to make them more efficient, I personally advocate capped public spending. We don&rsquo;t need billions spent on commercials. I also would like Congress to pass a law that effectively overturns the SCOTUS Citizens United case by declaring spending money is not free speech.</p>

			 <p>Democrat led state legislatures should be writing laws that hold election officials accountable for not certifying elections for frivolous reasons. I suspect a Republican plan is to flood the system with elections claims no matter whether there is evidence just to create chaos. All of the 2020 claims that went to court lost, and I suspect a good number of them fell in to what I consider frivolous and that will keep happening while there are no consequences.</p>

			 <p>The Cubs have been playing better since the All Star break and have got themselves to 1 game below .500, making the series against Cleveland that starts tonight important. The Cubs have a favorable schedule for August so they have a chance to put their record well above that .500 mark and make the Wild Card race interesting for their fans. Right now the Cubs are 3 games out of a final Wild Card spot but their are four other teams ahead of them. All the Cubs have to do is keep winning.</p>

			 <p>Finding that a company is a monopoly matters less than determining a proper remedy, which is not the same as punishment. The purpose of the remedy in antitrust law should be restoration of competition in the market in which a company is deemed to monopolize.</p>
<p>The judge has found Google to be a monopoly in a very specific market, and so the remedies that ought to be decided on should be intended to restore competition in that market. My interpretation of the ruling is that Google is a monopolist of the market of selling text ads as part of web search results and it gained that monopoly by paying Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine of their products.</p>
<p>In my opinion the remedy in the context of the market above is specific and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what Ben Thompson suggests<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, prohibit Google from entering contracts to make Google Search the default search engine for other products and dissolve existing contracts. I do not think breaking up Google would have any affect of restoring competition in the text ad in web search results market. Note that such a remedy would not prevent a company like Apple to continue to use Google as the default they just wouldn&rsquo;t get paid by Google to do so, and I wonder whether not allowing Google to be selected as the default for a period of time would be more harmful to Apple or Mozilla than Google. In fact, Apple and Mozilla stands to lose a lot money from such a remedy.</p>
<p>Some will suggest that Android should be split of as a separate company, but does Android have a significant amount of share of the smartphone market for that to matter?  I don&rsquo;t think so, and consequently the more meaningful remedy is tied to Apple. If Apple is not paid by Google to be the default search engine on Apple products, would Apple choose Bing or DuckDuckGo?</p>
<p>We learned from the Microsoft Antitrust case in the 90s that final resolution of antitrust law takes a long time and markets will change during that time. What is more likely to happen is that by the time the case moves through the appeals process to the Supreme Court users may be using AI-based tools in place of Google search.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2024/07/31/after-the-trade.html">After The 2024 Trade Deadline</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2024/07/31/after-the-trade.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-07-31 09:23:00 -0400">Jul 31, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Officially the All-Star game is considered to be the half-way mark of a MLB season, but the real mid-season milestone that matters is the trade deadline. The actions taken by a team by the trade deadline indicate whether the team management thinks it can make the playoffs, if they do then they will try to make trades that help the team win in the current season, otherwise they start work on the next season. Jed Hoyer&rsquo;s comments that he was focusing on 2025 was indication that Cub&rsquo;s management doesn&rsquo;t expect to make the playoffs this year.</p>
<p>Last season the Chicago Cubs were surprising buyers at the deadline, having gone on a winning streak that convinced Jed Hoyer the team had the shot at a wildcard spot, but that didn&rsquo;t happen and David Ross the scapegoat. Now this season, after signing Craig Counsell to the highest salary of any MLB manager the Cubs are last in the NL Central with a 51-58 record and they are seven games out of the last wild card spot. In short, the Cubs are  likely not making the playoffs this year. Are they going to fire Counsell?</p>
<p>Even though the playoff positioning is different between last year and this year, a fair assessment is that the team is really no better than  the year before, nor the year before that or any other year up to 2016. What we have is the same problems of unreliable hitting and pitching from the bullpen. The fact that the 2024 team&rsquo;s starting pitching has been so good is as much an indicator of how much MLB has changed since 2016 than anything. It used to be that teams with strong starting pitching were winners, but the game now does not rely so much on starting pitching to win games.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of starting pitching in the game today is to not lose the game in the first five innings by not giving up more than three runs, the bullpen is expected to now win every game by not giving up any runs. If that weren&rsquo;t bad enough, hitting is a completely lost art in baseball, with hitters needing only a .244 batting average to be considered good. The game has come down to this, pitching keeping the opponents from hitting home runs until your own batters hit two or more home runs.</p>
<p>The Chicago Cubs line up has been made up of the similar type of unreliable hitters for nearly a decade now, which is a clear indicator to me that the front office&rsquo;s idea of what is a major league hitter is out of sync with reality. As long as Hoyer is running the Cubs they will not be any different, and so it&rsquo;s on ownership to recognize the insanity of continuing to do the same thing and expecting a different result.</p>
<p>If I were the owner of the Chicago Cubs, now that the trade deadline has past, I would fire Hoyer immediately to signal that it&rsquo;s time for a change. Take the time to review and interview people over the remainder of the season to find the right replacement to have your new front office in place before the off season begins in earnest.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am convinced that a problem, may be even &ldquo;the&rdquo; problem, is that there is too much religion in America, and people do not recognize this problem because they have a too narrow definition of religion. Religion is anything, usually a group of people or an institution, to which one identifies themselves with and is loyal to because they derive meaning from that group. For example, complete this sentence, &ldquo;I am&hellip;.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you are like me you will find yourself making many &ldquo;I am &hellip;&rdquo; statements that not only include faith-based groups like &ldquo;I am Christian&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am Muslim&rdquo; but also, &ldquo;I am a father,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am a woman&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;I am a Green Bay Packer fan,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am a NASCAR fan&rdquo;. For too many today, their answers are also &ldquo;I am a Republican&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a liberal&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a conservative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So many groups to which we bind our selves to and that which demand our loyalty. I think all of these religions, yes even the faith-based ones, tend to be practices of idolatry. My understanding of religion explains how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Donald Trump has managed to change what it means to be an evangelical Christian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a person who supports Donald Trump rather than a person who believes in the divinity of Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus is not the founder of the religion known by 90% of the world as Christianity, that religion was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine. Jesus founded a movement, a way from religion that demands our loyalty toward our true selves as kin of of the divine, the divine that simply is &ldquo;I am&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Over the years I have heard it said that the Democrat and Republican political parties are essentially the same. To the extent they are both political parties, this is true, but I think the real consequential factor in the United States since 2016 is how different the parties have become. How it came to be that Biden dropped out of the 2024 Presidential race as the Democrat candidate will not and cannot happen in the Republican party because nobody in that party has the willingness, strength of character, or courage to challenge its king. The 2024 Federal and State elections are truly about two different parties. Democrats will challenge their leaders, and I believe would impeach and convict their President if found guilty, Republicans will not challenge their President nor impeach him let alone convict him, as we have seen them do when the House impeached Trump twice. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it imperative members of Congress put their oath to preserve, defend, and protect the Constitution above party.</p>

			 <p>What I know is that Jesus taught love expressed as forgiveness as non-violent resistance against the idea that the only way to peace is through violence. Practicing hope, faith, and love is our tools. I have found the best way to feel hope is to practice gratitude. The question is not why there is evil in the world, the real question is why there is any good! Whether you chose to follow Jesus or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/198594-when-i-was-a-boy-and-i-would-see-scary">Mr. Rogers</a>, look for the good that is all around you, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A27&amp;version=NIV">do not be afraid</a>.</p>

			 <p>I agree with all of <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/20/124109.html">Dave&rsquo;s points here</a> about the Democrat candidacy for President. As much as I dislike straight party voting, I think in this election, no matter who are the actual people running, our votes are for either a Democrat or Republican governing.</p>
<p>We need to be focusing more on the Senate than the President. The Senate&rsquo;s power to convict an impeached President is now the only constitutional check against the President. We cannot trust Republicans to impeach one of their own no matter what they do, this is how far over the cliff Republicans have gone.</p>
<p>Finally, I think there needs to be much more talk about how Trump politicized a national emergency (COVID). The moment Trump started prioritizing federal assistance to states with governors who bend the knee to him is the moment he showed how he thinks and feels about people.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062964960">Render Unto Caesar</a> by John Dominic Crossan 📚</p>
<p>Most of Crossan’s writing puts the teaching of Jesus within our human evolutionary challenge. Human ego desires to be in control and believes there can only be one, and this norm of civilization sees the only way toward peace is violence. (The fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a metaphor for human ego.)</p>
<p>Jesus teaches that there is another way, one of nonviolent resistance practiced by love of opponent (enemy) and neighbor, expressed by forgiveness. I am convinced that left to our own ego driven evolution, humanity with destroy itself. Only the Way taught by Jesus will save us from what appears to be inevitable.</p>

			 <p>The way political parties vet their candidates for President is through primary elections. Democrats making claims that Biden&rsquo;s advisors have been shielding him really ought to be pointing fingers at the DNC.

			 <p>Seems to me that the SCOTUS ruling yesterday means that any order the President gives to the military is lawful. In other words, it sure looks to me like SCOTUS has made it perfectly legal for the President to overthrow the government because the military cannot discern what is lawful and not lawful. If the Senate is about to convict the President on articles of impeachment, the President can just order the Military to take over/arrest Congress and how are they going to be able to say that is not a lawful order?  Bear in mind, the military is the actual ultimate authority of the United States. No police force and no citizen militia can stand against it, the only possible intervention would be another military. No person given the power of absolute immunity should be commander and chief of the military.</p>

			 <p>As far as I can tell, one of the main measures that a typical person has for inflation is the price of gas. Many complaints I read about Biden are related to gas prices. I don&rsquo;t think there is an honest understanding of how gas prices work, in my opinion gas companies take advantage of every opportunity (wars, disasters, oil refinery issues) to bump up prices that rarely return to prior levels for any length of time. Do you think we will ever see gas below $3 per gallon (on average) again? Is this the fault of the President of the United States, or is it the fault of greedy corporations?

			 <p>Over the last year we&rsquo;ve seen Microsoft, Google, and now Apple demonstrate what they are doing with AI.  As a somewhat casual observer, it seems to me all of these announcements fall in what I will call a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; category. Microsoft added a ChatGPT bot to Bing so Google had to add Gemini chat to Search. Microsoft added AI features to Office and Google did the same to Gmail and Docs. The problem with this matching of functionality is that both companies are focused on each other rather than their customers.</p>
<p>The main challenges to broad use of the latest AI tools are how easy they are to use and explaining what specifically they do and why a person should want to use them. So far the most publicized uses are enhanced search, writing, and creating pictures. In a way not unlike<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how the handwriting recognition of the Apple Newton Messagepad was treated<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, there is more attention put on how these AI tools are doing things wrong and often times with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hilarious results<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Personally, my use of GPTs has been as an enhanced search, and I prefer to do my own writing.</p>
<p>How Microsoft and Google have handled AI as response to each other is not surprising because honestly that is how these companies operate as they are competing against each other for corporate customers. Microsoft and Google both have retail consumer products but these are layers on top of a corporate DNA, and frankly it shows. Apple&rsquo;s DNA has consumers woven from top to bottom and we see and feel this in their actual products and how they talk about them, and frankly that makes them more relatable and trustworthy to consumers.</p>
<p>While I find it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hokey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the &ldquo;branding&rdquo; of these features as &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Intelligence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; is consistent with Apple&rsquo;s opinionated approach to all technology. Apple&rsquo;s message is clear, they are not going to use AI in the same way as others, so much so that they call it something similar to but not the same was what others call it. Apple is saying AI is not Artificial Intelligence, it&rsquo;s Apple Intelligence.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple is doing the same thing as Microsoft and Google in adding AI features to their first party products, but there is a key differentiation between Apple and these others,  Apple is a hardware company and AI might be the biggest gift to Apple&rsquo;s long term prospects since the mobile phone. The biggest question at Microsoft and Google right now is, how can they make money from AI, and it turns out that for them the AI revenue flow looks the same as advertising and search, but that is not how AI generates revenue.</p>
<p>The hottest company on the planet right now is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nvidia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who manufacture the processing chips (GPUs) AI needs to quickly provide results. Ever since Apple announced they put their M1 processors in iPads and similar high end processors in the iPhone, there have been questions about why Apple is putting all this processing horse power in these products when it will never be fully used. The answer to that question should be obvious now, that processing power is needed to run these new AI tools with performance similar to Nvidia. People expect Apple to keep their data on their iPhones, iPads, and Macs and their processors allow them to do that.</p>
<p>I own the Macbook Air that has Apple&rsquo;s first M-series processor, and its going to be three years old in November.  The Macbook Air M1 does everything I normally do, web browsing, checking email, some writing, crunching numbers, so fast I can&rsquo;t imagine when I will need to replace it for these purposes. Last week I installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ollama<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on this Macbook Air so that I can run AI models like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->llama3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> locally and for the first time since I&rsquo;ve owned it the Macbook was slow! Before this I imagined the reason why I would replace this Macbook Air is that Apple no longer supported it in the latest release of OS X, which could be ten years from now, but now I know that if I want to run future models locally I will want a newer Macbook.</p>
<p>Cloud-based AI has it&rsquo;s place in providing widely available information in a comprehensible manner, but when it comes to actually doing things for people, that AI processing will need to be on the edge and near the people. The people behind <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Rabbit R1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Humane AI Pin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recognize this, but both are physically small and thus constrained. The perfect AI edge device is the smartphone, and so AI fits &ldquo;glove-in-hand&rdquo; with Apple&rsquo;s core consumer product, while neither Microsoft or Google have such product. For Apple AI is not the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; and it will never be the &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; their &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is Apple silicon put in iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and AI makes the best case for the need of that &ldquo;thing&rdquo; than anything that has come before.</p>

			 <p>Google has released <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an update to NotebookLM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that allows one to provide specific sources to Google&rsquo;s Gemini LLM, store the results from questions about those sources, and write and store your own notes. I first learned about NotebookLM from Steven Johnson who advised Google in its development of this product. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Johnson is the author of several books<!-- raw HTML omitted --> such as &ldquo;How We Got To Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&rdquo; and has used DEVONThink for is research and writing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Johnson describes NotebookLM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the type of tool he would find useful in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his research and writing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, suggesting that NotebookLM is intended to fill scholarly and writing type use cases.</p>
<p>I am following the development of and trying out NotebookLM because the use cases Johnson describes align with my interests. Right now Google is focusing on input of content and there are no formal methods for producing output beyond copy and paste. I assume at some point in time Google will allow creation of documents in Google Docs.</p>
<p>Prior releases of NotebookLM allowed me to upload a small number of PDFs or Google Docs from Google Drive as sources, and the new update allows me to specify web sites. It does not crawl an entire domain, it appears to GET the HTML page for the URL you provide. I have found that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Winer&rsquo;s Old School CMS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that publishes my Daynotes structures the writing in a way that works well with NotebookLM.</p>
<p>As you can see from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monthly Index<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Old School creates a page for each month of the year for all of the posts published in that month, for example here are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all of the blog posts I wrote in February, 2024.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> To have NotebookLM use my Daynotes as the source for answers all I have to do is provide it the URL for each of the monthly pages. I am surprised that so far I haven&rsquo;t reached a limit to the number of web site URLs I can provide as sources because there is a limit in how many files (PDFs or Google Docs) one can provide.</p>
<p>I have entered all of the monthly URLs for 2021 through May, 2024 and then asked it to summarize what I wrote about in each year. You can save responses to the notebook, but sources are not included in what is saved, although you can get to them from the chat. When you click a source link from chat a pane opens with the source content that you can highlight and then save verbatim to the notebook or have Gemini summarize the highlighted content and save the summarization to a note.</p>
<p>One can copy and paste the content of a note, and I did that with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2022 Summary of my daynotes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, pasting it in to Drummer. I lightly edited the result in Drummer for formatting. My recommendation to Google would be to create the notes in markdown so that formatting will also carry over.</p>

			 <p>The author of this article, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AI Alignment Is Trivial<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is overlooking the lessons learned from the Internet. The real concern is not with the technology, but rather knowing our own flaws as humans. The author seems to be saying that we humans have control over the situation because all we have to do is not &ldquo;program&rdquo; AI with things like ambition. Unfortunately, we know there will be people who in fact will &ldquo;program&rdquo; AI to do these things in order achieve their own ambitions. All of technology, and AI in particular, is an amplification of humanity&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. One of our weaknesses is not knowing that there are things that even if we can do them, we should not do them. AI alignment is not trivial because human alignment is impossible.</p>

			 <p>In the Atlantic there is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (subscription required) that is an ode to the one-hand backhand, which is how I was taught to play tennis, but is rarely used today because tennis, like most sports, has devolved into all power. The author extends this point to basketball and the three point shot and he could have also made the point with pitching in Major League Baseball. All are examples, in an innocuous topic as sports, of how the ends now justify the means.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even an unguardable move such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s iconic “skyhook” would lose its luster in today’s money-balled NBA, where the statisticians have proved that the smartest way to play involves enormous quantities of three-point shots. There have perhaps never been more talented athletes and marksmen and less variety of gameplay. Everyone leverages the same generic (if often impressive) step-back three.</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781451419979">Naming the Powers</a> by Walter Wink 📚</p>
<p>I think this is a good book (series of books actually) for those who desire to follow Jesus to read at this time. The quote below is just one example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Weather Underground correctly criticized the U.S. government for its barbaric violence in Vietnam and then mirrored the very barbarism it condemned by adopting violence as its means. <strong>Whenever we let the terms of struggle be dictated by the Power that we oppose, we are certain to become as evil.</strong> Nothing about this insight is new. It is written for anyone to read in Rev. 17:15-18. There the Beast on whom the Harlot (Roma) sits turns against her and shifts his allegiance to the ten enemy kings. These will hate the harlot and burn her up with fire. The Beast can shift loyalties precisely because he knows that the means employed to overthrow the Harlot will make the kings every bit as much the children of hell as she. (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that in the above Wink is referring to the Weather Underground as known as The Weathermen. The Weathermen emerged from the campus-based opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War and from the civil rights movement of the 1960s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground">Wikipedia</a></p>

			 <p>For those who wish to  use their vote to protest the U.S. participation in the genocide occurring in Gaza with their vote for President, I suggest you consider two things. First, if Trump is President rather than Biden would our participation be any different? Second, if Trump is President, which means Republicans rule, how likely do you think you can succeed at forcing change?  Finally, accept that for any person to be elected President in the United States they need to be a viable national candidate with a real chance to win the electoral college. The candidate must win states not just votes. I also think for change to really occur the Senate is what needs to change more than the President. No law passes in the United States without votes from 60 or more Senators. No person becomes Supreme Court Justice without votes from 60 or more Senators. Focus on the Senate. How do your state&rsquo;s Senators view Gaza?</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101980972">Democracy in Chains</a> by Nancy MacLean 📚</p>
<p>Yesterday I read <a href="https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01hyx7pv8w8ymf17zknx87p6tk">an article</a> about James Buchanan that is inspired by this book, which I remembered I had in my Amazon library but not yet started reading. Consequently, I started reading and once again reminded of how the United States was founded.</p>
<p>The narrative taught when I was in school is that most people who immigrated to the new world did so to escape persecution, which was true for many people who came to the continent AFTER it was discovered. The motives behind the discovery of the continent was driven by wealth, whether through a shorter trade route to the east or the appropriation of land or gold.</p>
<p>Common folks who left Europe for a better life where not too much involved with the government or the decision to declare independence from England. The people who formed the United States did so to preserve their wealth, much of which starting to be generated from the plantations of the south.</p>
<p>Once the revolutionary war was over the people who sought independence had to decide how the new world was to be governed. Eventually what we know as the U.S. Constitution was drafted, but there was <a href="https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/teacher-resources/infographic-differences-between-federalists-and-antifederalists">strong debate</a> over whether there should be a single entity and a strong federal government or a federation of sovereign states. Advocates of a federation, who became known as anti-federalists, were fearful of a central government impinging upon individual rights, which honestly had much to do with the right to become as wealthy was one wishes in whatever manner one wishes, including enslaving others.</p>
<p>History says a compromise was reached with the Bill of Rights and the Federalists won the day, but the Federalists/Anti-Federalist debate, which was about power, continues. It lead to the Civil War and it is the root of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/dobbs_v._jackson_women%27s_health_organization_%282022%29#:~:text=of%20the%20fetus.-,Dobbs%20v.,people%20and%20their%20elected%20representatives.%E2%80%9D">Dobbs Decision</a>, and as this book chronicles, the Anti-Federalist cause has been systemically been carried out over the last five decades. I am convinced their success is in large part due to the profound lack of knowledge about history.</p>

			 <p>As I reflect upon <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what I wrote earlier today<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about Memorial Day, it occurs to me that my thoughts about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the meaning and purpose of this day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are consistent with how I was always taught. Memorial Day is a day of remembering those who died in service for our country, yes, and because of those sacrifices I enjoy freedom. What an individualistic point of view to think of how I benefited from the sacrifice others! What is lost in narrowing the view down to myself is seeing the good in the sacrifice.</p>
<p>We live in an extremely cynical world that teaches humanity only seeks personal advantage, that we are primarily driven by self-interest. The concept of sacrifice pushes against this cynicism. People who run into a burning building and sign up to serve in the military do not want to die but they understand the possibility and and do anyway because they are not driven by self-interest.</p>
<p>It is good to remember those who died in service to our country, and it is even better to remember why they died, which was less for our individual freedom and more for something beyond themselves, something good that they themselves would not enjoy. Cynicism and contempt of others is not the lesson of Memorial Day. Cynicism teaches us why there is evil, but in a such a worldview the far more interesting and important questions is, why is there any good?</p>

			 <p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tariffs on imports<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from China first imposed by Trump and continued by Biden did not increase jobs in the U.S. but increased prices. While imports from China decreased they were simply replaced by imports from other countries. Assuming the purpose for the tariffs was to increase jobs in the U.S., it should be obvious this would happen because the tariffs don&rsquo;t address the root cause problem which is that corporations are not really interested in hiring more workers in the United States.  On the whole the United States is the last place a corporation wants to add labor because it has the highest cost. Imposing tariffs is simply pandering for votes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was mostly offline the last week as I on the road visiting family and friends. Catching up on my feeds, I see the reactions to the reviews of the new iPads that are predictable because they have been the same for the last five years or so now. All new iPad hardware is fantastic but hampered by the  operating system software. The real problem with these observations is that they are redundant and pointless unless one is reviewing a new release of iPad OS.</p>
<p>All technical reviews are opinion pieces. Ultimately, the author of the review is expressing an opinion about whether the product being reviewed is good or bad and whether the reader should buy the product or not, and I think it is the later point some people are reacting to.  Two types of readers/potential buyers exist, a small group of whom have never owned an iPad and another group that will considering upgrading from an older model to a new model.</p>
<p>The decision to upgrade is the tougher one because there are really few reasons to upgrade. The iPad Air I bought in 2020 runs everything I need it to run and will get the latest version of iPad OS when it is released. When I read in a review that iPad OS does not take full advantage of the hardware capability my simple translation is, it&rsquo;s not worth the money to upgrade. (Ironic side note, the iPad seems to be opposite of planned obsolescence and there seems to be a negative reaction, which makes me wonder whether we are too condition for planned obsolescence. )</p>
<p>Should a person who does not own an IPad buy the latest one? The answer to that question is easier, if they have a need or desire for an iPad they should buy whichever model they can afford. None of the reviews I have read even consider recommending their readers buy an Android, Chrome OS, or Windows (Surface) tablet because it is generally accepted that the iPad is best tablet on the market.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the reviews are really not reviews but instead editorials expressing ways in which Apple could improve the iPad or iPad OS. Editorials usually invite disagreement and so it is surprising when the authors of these articles are surprised by the disagreement as if they don&rsquo;t know they wrote an editorial rather than a review. If the same story is being written after every release of a new iPad, perhaps it&rsquo;s time for a different story.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Winer recently wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that we in the United States are already living in an authoritarian state. He cites as evidence the probability that SCOTUS will say the President of the United States is in fact above the law and notes that the Supreme Court has always been above the law. If one takes a honest look back at the history of the United States you will see that it has always been an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->oligarchy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rather than a democracy.</p>
<p>The founders intended our government to be a republic, a representative democracy, rather than a pure democracy, that would prevent tyranny, but their intentions were thwarted as soon <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as political parties arose to control/influence our representatives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Go back and look at the definition of oligarchy and consider whether political parties are nothing but classes of people who see the power of government vested in themselves.</p>
<p>Political parties are to democracy what monopolies are to capitalism, both corrupt the founding principles of their institutions, and those who enjoy the privileges of the power these oligarchies provide do everything they can to preserve those privileges.</p>
<p>Consider the wealth of the founding fathers, most of whom were white, male, property owners. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Washington<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jefferson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> owned plantations. When they wrote that all men were created equal, they assumed it understood that meant white, male, property owners and not others.

<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Federalists vs Anti-Federalists debates<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Three-Fifths Compromise<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and associated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electoral College<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Civil War<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Women&rsquo;s Suffrage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Crow Laws<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were all moments when the true nature of the founding of the Unites States was exposed.  What we are experiencing in the United States today is a continuation of how it has always been in the United States, the difference now is that the oligarchs have become so confident that they no longer care to continue pretending that there is actual democracy. The oligarchs have been able to convince a majority of the citizens of the United States that their aims align with the oligarchs, it is the realization of the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->trickle down<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; ideology that Ronald Reagan preached.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence has always hidden the prime question of civilization in plain sight.  When <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jefferson wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question is, liberty for whom?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Truth is, the norm of civilization on the Earth, which over time has been called different things but which can be simply stated as empire, has never allowed for liberty of everyone. Over the course of history different forms of government have existed and even those that claim to be democracies institute class hierarchies that provide liberty for some at the expense of others. Governments are institutions of humans and reflect our human dualistic view of the world. Governments are necessary and not particularly bad, but humans need to be self aware of our instincts and vigilant at guarding against them.</p>
<p>I believe the form of democracy in the United States as intended to exist through purpose, not the literal words, of the U.S. Constitution is as good a government that can provide liberty for everyone as any in the world, so long as citizens push back against our habit of seeing ourselves as better than and apart from our neighbor. I think such vigilance takes the form of placing core values above all others.</p>
<p>One such core value is what does liberty mean? You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look up the word liberty in a dictionary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and you will find several descriptions of what one may think of as freedom, but for me liberty boils down to my control over my body, which is exercised in many different ways such as to do as I please, to be free from restraint, and to decide what does and does not happen to my body.  A Supreme Court that is unwilling to recognize that liberty, which is intended to be enshrined by our founding documents, extends to women&rsquo;s right to decide what happens to their body is violating the core value of liberty.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights defines other core values, but perhaps one most overlooked but closely related to liberty is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Ninth Amendment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that states that it is the citizens who claim our rights and not only the Constitution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Constitution does not deny the rights retained by the people. Is a Supreme Court, or for that matter any member of Congress or President of the United States, that does not seem to know the definition of liberty or seeks to deny rights retained by the people acting in the best interests of the people as their representatives or are they acting in the best interests of their oligarch class?</p>
<p>It is true that the founders, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like Plato<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were not fond of pure democracy and thus created a republic as a representative form of democracy. The founders were also not fond of the authority of the monarchy they just fought a war against, and so they created a system of government intended to preserve the best features of democracy while preventing against  tyrannies be they of individuals or classes. Among but not limited to these features are the unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (Note the similarity between the Declaration and the Ninth Amendment) Beware of attempts to throw out democracy in the bathwater for that is language the political party oligarchs use to claim liberty for themselves at the expense of others. Let us be vigilant for that more perfect union that Madison wrote in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Preamble of the U.S. Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I am beginning to think that while much focus is on the upcoming Presidential election what may be more important is Democrat majorities in the Senate and House. Only a single party majority of both houses makes impeachment a real power over the President.

			 <p>In my opinion the Presidential Immunity case before the Supreme Court could be the most consequential to the future of the United States of any case in my life time. The case raises the question of whether Richard Nixon was right in his claims that a President of the United States can never go before the court, that they are not really bound by the rule of law. Had Gerald Ford not given Nixon a pardon it is likely that the Supreme Court in that day would have heard a case similar to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the one before them now for Trump<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I can see a Supreme Court of justices who claim to be originalists proclaim that the President is above the law because the U.S. Constitution has holes as it is made of words. When fundamentalists only look for words and ignore meaning or intent that enables them to promote an ideology. The originalist ideology seems intent on returning us to  past centuries in which white men held all the power and for which liberty only applied.</p>
<p>If the United States is a nation based on the rule of law, and the Supreme Court says that rule of law does not apply to the President, how can the republic remain based on the rule of law?</p>

			 <p>Dave Winer is putting much effort into rebooting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogrolls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which traditionally are a list of other blog sites shown on the right side of a main blog page. Back when blogging was more social than commercial blogrolls where a method of helping readers to find other blogs to read.  You might recognize how on the right side of many blogs there are lists like Recent Posts and Archives such as on one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my WordPress sites<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the placement of a blogroll is consistent with that layout.</p>
<p>When I compare the layout of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my WordPress site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Daynotes site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the column to the right in WordPress appears to be a part of the page whereas the blogroll on the Daynotes page is obviously a different part. It&rsquo;s a nit I know, but I prefer how it looks in WordPress when I compare the two.</p>
<p>Shortly after Dave began posting about his work, Manton <!-- raw HTML omitted -->added blogroll support<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, albeit with some differences. The blogroll support in micro.blog, which is being called Recommendations, is not connected to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which means the list of blog sites is stored and maintained separately and that is unfortunate. You can import an OPML file of the sites to micro.blog, but then have to maintain the items in micro.blog rather than in Feedland.  One can delete and re-create a Recommendation, however.</p>
<p>Another difference is that micro.blog produces a static list, which is consistent with how blogrolls originally function, but doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of Dave&rsquo;s latest work that shows which of the sites have new posts to read. On the other hand, the links to the sites in the list is much more obvious to the reader than with the blogroll widget that Dave created. Compare the list on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Daynotes page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogroll page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have created here. On the Daynotes page I can tell which blog has been recently updated, then a user has to click to expand to see the entries of the site and then know to click the date/time to the right of an entry to read the item. On the blogroll page all you see is the hyperlink to the site, which is more obvious to a reader, but one then has to go to each site to discover and read new entries. Tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The blogroll of my main blog is part of a page of the site that the reader needs to navigate to, which is due to my choice of template rather than a limitation of micro.blog. Manton&rsquo;s blog shows the list of Recommended Blogs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on its main page.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I am personally torn on which is better because I like having just my writing appearing on the blog pages rather than the right side items you see on some sites. On the other hand, if the blogroll is not on the main page what is the probability that a reader will ever see it? I guess this begs the question, do readers actually click through to any of the sites on the blogroll?</p>

			 <p>Yesterday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GM announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it is moving its headquarters from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Renaissance Center<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the new Hudson building next year. The announcement has me feeling sad.  I moved to the Detroit area in 1989 to start my career with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electronic Data Systems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (EDS), which then was a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors. I could have worked at any one of dozens of offices in the Detroit area that EDS or GM occupied, but my job was located at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the General Motors Building<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, now known as Cadillac Place, a beautiful building designed by architect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albert Kahn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and constructed in the early 1920s. Every work day for two years I walked through the architectural marvels that are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fisher<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and GM Buildings.</p>
<p>In 1995 GM spun off EDS into an independent company and to complete that spin off EDS paid GM $500 million. A year later GM announced it was buying the Renaissance Center for $73 million and moving their headquarters to that building. I remember watching the announcement GM made to their employees that featured an animation of a helicopter placing the GM logo on the top of the RenCen tower. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six  years later EDS announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it was consolidating some of its Detroit offices, all used in support of GM, into Tower 500 of the Renaissance Center, and a few years after that I moved into a brand new cube in the newly renovated tower.</p>
<p>Detroit today looks very different than it did back in 1996, back then the Detroit riverfront as mostly discarded properly with piles of dirt or dirt parking lots. Today a beautiful walking path stretches from Belle Isle south by about five miles, connecting a few new parks along the way. The difference one sees in Detroit today can be traced back to GM&rsquo;s purchase of the Renaissance Center and the millions of dollars it spent to revitalize the riverfront area. I am certain that without the investment that GM made Dan Gilbert would not have been as interested to make the investments in Detroit that lead to the new tower on the Hudson site.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed my years working at the Renaissance Center, although the commute that could stretch for more than an hour if there were an accident, not so much. Whenever there was an event, like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Super Bowl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Bull air races<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or when there were parades for the Detroit Red Wings or Pistons championships, the RenCen was energetic.</p>
<p>The announcement yesterday did not include any information about the future of the RenCen. While GM and its subsidiaries occupied nearly the whole of all four office towers, that began to decrease over time either through head count reductions or by GM&rsquo;s sale/spinoff of GMAC/Ally Finanicial that moved to another office building in Detroit. During my time working at the RenCen EDS went from occupying all 13 floors of Tower 500 to slowing emptying out floors of that building and ultimately ending up in two floors of Tower 100, and at that time EDS was again acquired, this time by Hewlett Packard. We eventually moved from the Renaissance Center to an entire office building in Pontiac until 2018 when the landlord of that build sold it and the now DXC Technology moved to two floors in building in Auburn Hills.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine the Renaissance Center being torn down because it is so iconic, but at the same time it is hard to imagine that much office space being occupied. Perhaps the center (tallest) tower can be renovated into a mix of hotel and loft/condos, but it is hard to imagine all four towers being occupied in such a manner. During the announcement yesterday it was said that GM, the city of Detroit, Wayne County, and Bedrock (Gilbert&rsquo;s company) will be working together to plan the future for the site. I will not be surprised if the four office towers are torn down with the tallest middle one remaining to make room for some new development.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t think it controversial to say that much of what ills the government of the United States is caused by money. What may be controversial is that I do not think giving money is an expression of free speech, rather I think the act of giving money is an emolument. Limiting the amount of money a corporation, committee, or individual gives to an elected official is not an infringement on free speech. Common sense tells us this and yet in 1990 SCOTUS in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said otherwise. In order to make a more perfect union, as Madison wrote in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the preamble to the Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I think we need clear definition that giving of money to elected officials in our republic is an emolument rather than an express of free speech.</p>
<p>The difference between money and speech lies in how much the person receiving either needs what is offered. Today elected officials, particularly federal officials, need a lot of money. The amounts of money needed by a person to be elected to office makes it something more than speech because it enables a smaller number of people to influence the person elected. One&rsquo;s need of money and the receipt of that money is a quid pro quo; the giver of the money expects something in return and that expectation makes the giving of money an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->emolument<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Federalist 39<!-- raw HTML omitted --> James Madison wrote, &ldquo;If we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established, we may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior. It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The founders knew how emoluments could lead to corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because they lived in a time when it was common practice for foreign countries to gain favor from monarchs by gift giving. Emoluments are not given as an act of generosity, they are given with the expectation of something in return. If you think about it, you could say that emoluments, the giving of gifts of large sums of money, is simply capitalism at work, and here in lies the circumstances we find ourselves in today.</p>
<p>We in the United States, so accustomed to our highly capitalistic society, have become numb to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->corrosive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nature of money and thus think little of emoluments. If we were to write the Constitution today we might not even include emolument clauses in it because they have become such a part of everyday life. The other side of that coin, however, is that everyone in our capitalistic society knows full well that when one person or one committee or one corporation writes a check for thousands, hundreds of thousands or more dollars to a politician it is done with the expectation of something in return. Enough money from a small group of people gains more influence than a citizen could ever hope to gain through exercising their right to free speech. Isn&rsquo;t this how elected officials pretty much ignore what their constituents say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that emoluments from &ldquo;any King, Prince, or foreign State&rdquo; is worse than emoluments from citizens, corporations, or Political Action Committees?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, like many things, many tend to take a literal view of corruption and emoluments. Huge election donations and lobbying come with expectations that effectively buy votes, but we don&rsquo;t think of this as corruption, at least not legally. However, I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can deny that huge part of our lack of trust in the institutions of government, or media (journalism), or medicine, is due in large part to an awareness of how much influence on decisions is being bought. The growing lack of trust in government is the corrosion (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) of the Republic in plain sight. (Further, if you think about it, much of the lack of trust in Biden or Trump is due to money!)</p>
<p>The founders of the United States knew full well the affect emoluments can have on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->republic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is why they included <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clauses in the Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to limit that affect. Unfortunately, the ideology of originalism says that literal words, not the meaning or intent, only matters. (Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism can mean that Supreme Court Justices could be replaced by AI.)  Originalists will say, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 only has the words &ldquo;from any King, Prince, or foreign State&rdquo; and there is no such prohibition of emoluments given from citizens of the United States, even if the very thing that clause was intended to prevent, which is the corruption of the government through quid pro quo, is what is happening.</p>

			 <p>Today is the Chicago Cub&rsquo;s home opener after they completed the first series of the season with one again and two loses against the Texas Rangers. Texas is the defending World Series champion and therefore is one of best teams, so not getting swept is a bonus. In fact, the Cubs came within inches of maybe winning the first game in the tenth inning when a foul ball hit by Christopher Morel just missed being a grand slam. Steele was keeping the Rangers lineup in check before he pulled a hamstring fielding a swinging bunt. Despite this, my reaction after one series is that the current Cubs lineup seems no better than last year&rsquo;s, with the same unreliable hitting, amplified by bad fielding.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Chicago Cubs have completed the 2024 Cactus League spring training &ldquo;season&rdquo; and will start the 2024 MLB season tomorrow at the Texas Rangers. As many questions exist about the 2024 team as did for the 2023 team, so it is hard for me to expect them to be too much better than last year. Will Greg Counsell as the new manager make a difference? Perhaps that is the main question going in to this season.</p>
<p>One cannot read much into what happens at spring training, although I attended spring training games in 2016, which is when the Cubs won the World Series, and have not attended a spring training game since nor have the Cubs returned to the World Series. Read in to that what you will.</p>
<p>For me what stood out most during spring training is that Seiya Suzuki continued hitting as well as he did in the second half of the 2023 season, and hopefully that will translate to a hot start for him in this season. Most Cub fans will say that Suzuki has not yet lived up to his potential, but we saw signs of that at the end of last year. I think it interesting that Suzuki may be hitting second to start the season so that he and Bellinger get as many at bats as possible during games. (Bellinger must bat no lower than third all season so he gets as many at bats as possible, something that David Ross refused to do last year.)</p>
<p>The two biggest (or three biggest depending on how you count) questions for the Cubs going in to this season are, will Morel and Busch succeed at third and first base and how will the starting pitching perform? Morel will get his best chance to prove he can be a reliable third baseman and Busch will get a chance to prove that he can produce at the plate. The Cubs have been searching for the next players at third and first ever since they traded away Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo, and from fans' perspective that search has taken too long.</p>
<p>Many more questions exist about the pitching staff, but I think they start with will Jameson Taillon live up to expectations? Taillon was the Cubs big pitching pick up before the 2023 season and he did not pitch well and had several injuries. The fact that Taillon is starting the 2024 season on the injury list does not bode well. I think the Cubs need Taillon to meet expectations for them to have a chance to win the N.L. Central.</p>
<p>Will Justin Steele and Kyle Hendricks repeat their performances in 2023? We will find out soon given that Steele will pitch against the defending World Series champions on Thursday night and then Hendricks will follow him on Saturday. Finally, will Shota Imanaga meet expectations in his first season or falter as many players do when moving from Japan to the United States?</p>
<p>Finally will the youngsters, Jordan Wicks and Javier Assad, improve upon their performances in 2023? The long term view for the Cubs relies heavily on their ability to promote pitching from within, and while Steele is a success story the MLB teams most successful over long periods of time have nearly their entire pitching staff come up from their farm system.</p>
<p>The 2016 World Series team had an established pitching staff so going in to that season there were more questions about their hitting and fielding than pitching. The 2024 team has significant questions in all three areas, which means the probability for them to have playoff success, if they make the playoffs, is lower than in 2016. Given that the Cubs have a new manager it might be more fair to compare this team to the 2015 team that made it to the NL championship, which is the first year Joe Maddon managed the team.</p>
<p>Despite the first year manager comparisons, I think it might be better to compare this team, or rather the entire Cubs organization, to the 2014 team. Back in 2014 many of their future stars were still in the minor leagues but on the brink of making it to the majors. During the 2024 spring training we saw many of the Cubs' future stars like Matt Shaw and Pete Crow-Armstrong perform well but sent back to the minors for further development. We probably will see some of those young players this season, but expect them to really push to start the 2025 season with the big team.</p>
<p>The 2014 team finished with a 73-89 record but the 2024 team has better players and a better manager, so I do expect them to compete for the NL Central division championship in September. On paper the Cubs should take control of the division, but I am not confident the Cubs have enough consistent batters to prevent the team from having long losing streaks. I therefore expect the 2024 team to be about the same as last year&rsquo;s team. The main problem with how David Ross managed the team last year is that he kept players who were not hitting in the line up too long. I am not sure whether Counsell will have less patience than Ross had, but his impatience may be what leads the team to win the division. What I do know is that I am going to have fun watching to see how they do. Let&rsquo;s play ball!</p>

			 <p>Apple will say that consumers benefit from their exclusive control over the iPhone ecosystem. I imagine that Google will say that consumers benefit from tying their ad business to search by providing consumers with more relevant ads. The problem is that in capitalism consumer benefit is not the ends, wealth generation is the ends. As a general principal, though not applied enough, the ends do not justify the means, particularly if in the United States the means result in harm to consumers.</p>

			 <p>Based on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what I&rsquo;ve read<!-- raw HTML omitted --> so far, it seems to me the biggest challenge the DOJ has in its lawsuit against Apple is convincing a court that there is such a thing as a premium smartphone market. In my opinion what the DOJ really means by a &ldquo;premium smartphone market&rdquo; is an iPhone market, in fact I think DOJ would have been smart to actually call it the iPhone market.</p>
<p>What defines a market? From a traditional lense, one may say there is no such thing as an iPhone market. However, the iPhone is not just a product, it also includes the App Store and accessories like the Apple Watch that are exclusive to the iPhone. Apple and most of the tech industry refers to this as the Apple or iPhone ecosystem and that ecosystem functions in ways that most will recognize as a market. Apple clearly uses monopoly power in its control of the iPhone ecosystem.</p>
<p>If one accepts the iPhone ecosystem is a market then I think Apple most clearly has a monopoly. While I am not even close to being a lawyer, I would think the next step is to convince a court that the iPhone ecosystem/market is large enough to cause harm to a significant number of U.S. citizens to justify government action. Unlike in Europe, antitrust in the U.S. is about harm to consumers and not harm to competitors.</p>
<p>So, if I am right, I think the big question being raised by the DOJ is a question about whether a product ecosystem is a market. The product ecosystem is fundamental to Apple&rsquo;s business model, and frankly many people benefit from that ecosystem. In some ways the issue of product ecosystems and antitrust has occurred before. At the time when phones were only landlines one could  only buy a phone from AT&amp;T and a DOJ lawsuit forced AT&amp;T to allow consumers to buy phones from other manufacturers. I am sure at the time AT&amp;T considered the phones as part of their product ecosystem and AT&amp;T did claim security and quality reasons for why they should be the exclusive providers of phones.</p>
<p>Despite what Apple says, they will fight this suit because the App Store and exclusive accessories like the Apple Watch are competitive advantages. Both are big revenue streams and Apple takes actions to protect those revenue streams. Apple has stated this approach is a fundamental part of their business model.</p>
<p>Consequently another big question being raised here is, if a company makes a product that is a platform for selling other products, is the owner of that platform allowed to be the exclusive store front for those products and require a portion of each sale of that product?  HP makes more money selling ink for their printers than in selling printers; Gillette makes money selling razor blades and practically gives away their shavers. Should a manufacturer of a computer platform be allowed to have an exclusive app store that is the only way for one to install apps on that platform?  The EU has said no, now the United States is attempting to say the same thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My approach to AI has been to embrace and extend my capabilities. I use quite a few tools with AI inside. Many of them have boosted my productivity. I am on the lookout for more to add to my arsenal, so I can become more effective when it comes to my creative output. I don’t need it to write for me. I need AI to make sure I don’t make spelling mistakes, point out some overused phrases, repetitive usage of phrases, and what my editors used to call “Om” things.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why an individual will want AI to write for them because I own (and want to own) my words because they reflect me. My writing is never about producing content and I don&rsquo;t make a dime from any of my web sites. I may be biased, but I think what makes it blogging is whether or not one is making money.</p>

			 <p>The upcoming U.S. Presidential election is unique in my life time in that it is an election between two incumbent Presidents. Consequently, we don&rsquo;t really need to focus on character issues because there is a record of what each candidate did in office. For example, Biden ought to focus on what Trump did and did not do about COVID-19 as his actions are on record as are the consequences, millions of people died while Trump was in office, unnecessarily. I also wish Biden, or pundits, would at least emphasize that there is a difference between feeling better and actually being better. Were you really better off when Trump was in office than you are now, or did you just feel better (were more entertained) while Trump was in office?  Finally, yes, inflation is an issue right now, and if we accept that government spending is the primary cause, let&rsquo;s note that it was Trump who signed and provided most of the COVID stimulus checks. Most economic circumstances are reactions to the past.</p>

			 <p>From &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Problem with Defining Antisemitism<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; by the New Yorker</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stern tells this story in “The Conflict Over the Conflict,” a work that is unlikely to please partisans. The book makes the case for bridging differences and recognizing nuance. It also describes Israeli-Palestinian history as an “ideal subject” to teach at universities, precisely because it is so divisive. At the West End Temple, Stern reiterated this belief. “On college campuses, students have an absolute right to expect they’re not going to be harassed, they’re not going to be bullied,” he said. “But to be disturbed by ideas is O.K.: we want students to be disturbed by ideas and to figure out how to think about them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read what is written about campuses today I find it hard to relate to my own experience between 1984 and 1989. I think an in-depth study of what has happened to U.S. universities since the mid-80s may be illuminating.  One aspect that I recall from my experience that may be related is a focus on getting a degree in order to get a job. Even back then going to college was becoming less about growing up and becoming a more complete person but rather most students I knew were focused on the goal of obtaining a high paying job. In such a climate I can see where college not being a place where one is disturbed by ideas might be expected because that climate put no value on such a thing.</p>

			 <p>It started with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post that Manton Reece wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about long form content publishing in a microblog format and before I knew it I had completely overhauled the appearance of this site. I wrote a reply to that post about my one wish for micro.blog is that it would not publish the full content of a titled post on the main page of the blog.  In my opinion posts with titles are essays that are best published in full on their own page. I said that I would rather have a link to essays along with a lede.</p>
<p>Manton replied suggesting that I try the Tiny theme and that sent me down an unexpected rabbit hole of testing the theme and different fonts before deciding to apply that theme to this site. If you are a regular reader of this site you should have notice I made several changes, starting with the title of the site.</p>
<p>Before I go in to how I came to the new title for this site I want to acknowledge <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matt Langford<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who developed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Tiny Theme<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for micro.blog. I&rsquo;ve not crossed paths with Matt, but I appreciate his work in developing the theme and the associated summary plugin. Right now I am using the basic functionality of the theme but there are features that I plan to check out more in the future.</p>
<p>The post you are reading right now provides an example of what started me off trying Tiny Theme. If you came to this post via the main page of this blog you saw the title of the post followed by the first paragraph followed by a Read More button. I think not publishing the full, multi paragraph post enables the main page to maintain a &ldquo;news feed&rdquo; like appearance. I expect it to also make loading the site faster because the pages are smaller. To read  the full titled post you can click either the title of the post or the Read More button.</p>
<p>Having changed the appearance of this site I felt it made sense to change the tagline and the title of the site. Rather than the tagline referring to me, I wanted it to refer to the theme of my writing and found that a sentence from the Thomas Merton quote on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my home page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> did the job nicely. I then used Microsoft Co-Pilot to brainstorm titles that related to the tagline and settled on Routine Revelations.</p>
<p>So welcome to my new, old blog where I write posts and share information about my extraordinary ordinary routine revelations!</p>

			 <p>A problem that I see about reporting on inflation is there is little understanding nor explanation for why inflation is occuring, only assumptions. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gas prices are clearly rising<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but why? It seems that gas prices always rise in the spring and summer and most assume that is due to demand. A related and important question, what can be done about it, and what could a President of the United States even do about it? My personal suspicion is that contrary to popular opinion, there is little that a Preside can do about most economic factors like inflation because they are driven mostly by the private sector.</p>

Looking back at that those phones the ones that stand out are the T-Mobile G1, the Nexus One, and the Nexus 6P.

After the Nexus One smartphones seem to all have the same physical features, which is a shame. The Nexus 6P stands out only because it is the largest phone I&rsquo;ve owned and reinforced my personal preference for smaller phones.</p>

			 <p>Assuming that Mitch McConnell sees himself as fighting a war for a better America by his definition for what that means, at some point he will realize that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->while he may have won some battles he lost the war<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. A large part of why that is happening is because, he along with many others in the United States have determined that the ends justify the means. Such thinking does away with principles because it leads to tunnel vision. The thing is, due to its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural founding, the United States has been unique in reliance on principals/values for existence. Freedom, liberty, or democracy, however you want to think of them are values that are de-valued when the ends justify the means. Consequently, the United States no longer strives for the ideals upon which it was founded and therefore will revert to the state to which it began.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been receiving many &ldquo;offers&rdquo; from AT&amp;T lately trying to get us to drop our landline and convert it to AT&amp;T&rsquo;s VoIP service.

One of the single biggest problems I have with VoIP is with what happens when there is a power loss.

			 <p>Despite <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reading more about the Apple Vision Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I have yet to warm up to the idea of strapping a headset on to my face, no matter the potential cost of the headset and the utility. I think back to the idea of one using notebook computers in meetings, many think that is rude or at the least too intrusive. While one can clearly take more detailed notes, there is a physical screen between oneself and other meeting participants. In this case tablets are more favorable because they can lie flat on table and be no more intrusive than a pad of paper.</p>
<p>While the Vision Pro does have a pass through mode that enables the wearer to see what is in front of them, it is obvious to others in the room that the wearer&rsquo;s attention is not fully on them. Anything physically larger than regular glasses is going to send signals to others, just like the use of notebook computers in meetings and classrooms. Consequently in it&rsquo;s current incarnation the Vision Pro is a very private device.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that over time the use of notebook computers has become more accepted and it happens now in nearly every meeting and probably every class in college, but that still doesn&rsquo;t make it right. When Google first released Glass the debates about the social norms for their use started but never ended because the product really never gained acceptance, these social discussions, and probably laws, will need to restart. For example, I think it is worth serious discussion about whether one should ever be allowed to wear the Vision Pro on a plane, which is a place in which ones attention can mean life or death. Most expect Vision Pro to succeed mostly because it is from Apple, but even Apple is not immune to flops.</p>
<p>So, then, the question is at what price point and for what utility will the Vision Pro gain acceptance? Do you spend $1,000 or more on monitor on you desk? Some do, most do not. I think the price is going to have to be closer to $500 in order to generating real sales. I have no doubt that will happen, just like how 4K desktop monitors are affordable and thus dominant in sales. How long will it take for the price to come down, and might that be too long for the Vision Pro to gain acceptance? Money may be on Apple&rsquo;s side, but we will see whether time is too.</p>

			 <p>Really good, and I think really important, column here by David Brooks in The Atlantic, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Zeitgeist of Doom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I think he correctly puts his finger on what we are experiencing right now in American society, a kind of peer pressure of negativity, that appears to be a badge of honor among both sides of the ideological and political spectrum. I confess to finding myself feeling this sense of doom, and worse the feeling there is nothing to be done. Here is the thing though, our pessimism is helping our opponents and does not actually make things better, it produces lose-lose results . So, not giving into negativity, focusing on being positive, recognizing much of life is better right now than it was 10, 20, 50 years ago, while at the same time being angry that so much more can be improved is an act of resistance.</p>

			 <p>Reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Winer&rsquo;s recollection<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of first seeing and using the Mac on the 30th anniversary of its introduction has me reflecting on my first encounters with the Mac during my freshman year of college in 1984-85. My work study assignment was the undergraduate computer science lab that was for all practical purposes put together specifically to be the home for six of the newly minted Macs. The CS department used the lab for teaching an experimental class in Pascal, but also came equipped with MacWrite and MacPaint. I was immediately enamored by these little computers that I had the good fortune to use whenever there were no other students using them, and I lusted over them for all five years I was in school. The price for the Macs were well out of my price range as were the IBM PCs that I could buy on a student discount. The first computer that I purchased was an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atari 800XL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> during my sophmore year, which I used for programming classes via VT100 terminal emulation connection to a mainframe and for writing papers. After I got my first job I bought an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atari 1040ST<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which mimics the Mac UI but cost much less. Finally I bought my first Mac, a Mac Mini in 2005.</p>

			 <p>Today I canceled my subscription and closed by account with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evernote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which most will think a trivial event. People stop using software all the time, except I&rsquo;ve been using Evernote from the beginning that it first became available for Windows in 2008. In fact, I am pretty sure that I first used a beta version of the product perhaps as early as 2005. At the time it was introduced no company was really developing notetaking software, at least not for Windows. When first introduced the UI of EverNote had the form of a continual scroll of information &ldquo;flagged&rdquo; by date, in fact it could be my first experience with the newsfeed/stream UI now commonly used by social networking applications.</p>
<p>The closest resemblance EverNote had to any other product was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the UI of the Newton OS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that ran on Apple&rsquo;s Newton Messagepad.  The resemblance may have been intentional because EverNote was founded by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stepan Pachikov<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who with his company Paragraph International, lead the development of the handwriting recognition engine known as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CalliGrapher<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which was licensed by Apple for use with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Newton OS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. EverNote&rsquo;s resemblance to Newton definitely drew my attention to the product.</p>
<p>Pachikov brought <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phil Libin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> onboard as CEO of Evernote (originally the product name had a capitalized N that was changed to lowercase by 2008) and Libin grew the company and the product into the well recognized, multi-platform product that most people know of it today. In my opinion what made Evernote attractive is that it centrally stored data (perhaps one of the first commercial client/server applications) that is accessible to client applications running on nearly every computing platform that I use. At a time when it was common to see applications that ran only on Mac or Windows, or iOS, Evernote ran any every single one of these platforms.</p>
<p>Of course, developing and then maintaining separate code bases for each platform is daunting, particularly if the application architecture was not explicitly developed for that use, and so over time bugs crept up that caused problems. The relatively fast growth of the product also lead to performance issues, and for some data loss.  For me Evernote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jumped the shark<!-- raw HTML omitted --> around 2013 when the company began licensing/selling products with Evernote branding, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like socks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that had no relationship to the core product, while there were significant problems with the Evernote app. One year after Libin left Evernote the company stopped selling these products.</p>
<p>It might be said that Evernote began its path of decent soon after Libin left the company in 2015. Key developers started to leave the company and  soon there  seemed to be yearly rumors of the company going under. While many who I associated with stopped using it, by 2015 I had accumulated seven years of information in the application and I felt the yearly $60 subscription was worth my continued access to that information from all the devices I use. The Evernote web clipper had become my most valued tool of all the software I use and it is still the best browser web clipping application available particularly on mobile devices. Unlike most other apps, sharing to Evernote on iOS and Android captures the entire web page rather than just the link to the page.</p>
<p>So, despite the dismal outlook for the company and the app, I stayed committed to it, but last year it was acquired by Bending Spoons and they changed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the subscription cost to $15 per month<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I decided was too expensive in light of what I pay in other software subscriptions. When the rumors of the demise of Evernote started appearing I began testing ways to export my information out of the application and import it into others. Two years ago I exported everything from Evernote to OneNote, which wasn&rsquo;t perfect but good enough for me to find information should I need to. Last year I found I could also import my Evernote archive into Obsidian, which I completed last fall and from that point stopped storing new information in Evernote.</p>
<p>My yearly subscription with Evernote renews at the end of January, so my deadline to delete my data from Evernote and close my account was this past weekend. Deleting my notes was much more laborious than I would have preferred, as a deleted note is moved to Trash and then one has to empty the Trash in order to completely delete the note and I found that Trash emptying seemed to only handle about 100 notes or so at a time, particularly with the web application. The problem seems to be with the synchronization performance, even the web app syncs data with the browser local storage, and I suspect there is Javasript handling all of the API calls to tell Evernote&rsquo;s servers to move and delete data.</p>
<p>I am obviously much more brand loyal than most other people, so it&rsquo;s really a big deal for me personally to stop using a product after having used it for more than ten years. Obviously, my issue is not with the product itself but the subscription cost that most likely is driven by a decreasing number of subscribers. I do expect Evernote to eventually disappear within the next year or two. Going forward I am using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joplin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to capture web clippings from Mac and Linux, tolerating the fact that sharing to Joplin with iPad only captures the link and not the web content. I have also started using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Archivebox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my home network. I am using end to end encryption with Joplin and using OneDrive as the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; for storing/syncing the data in Joplin between my desktops and iPad. Unfortunately the Android version of Joplin does not synchronize well and I gave up even trying to use it on my Pixel 7a.</p>

			 <p>What separates the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Boox Note Air 3C<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from competing products is that it has the Google Play store and is capable of running any Android application. Note however that eInk displays do not have the fast refresh of traditional tablet displays and therefore not all applications will run well,  but apps like Readwise Reader and Google Calendar are a  good fit. I narrowed my choices of which eInk device to buy to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Supernote Nomad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the Boox Note Air 3C and then picked the Note Air 3C because it can run any Android app whereas the Supernote is limited to only the Kindle app. The tradeoff is that reviews indicate Supernote has some functionality in its note taking capability that Boox does not have, and the Supernote Nomad is smaller and lighter than the Note Air 3C.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was fun for me as a football fan. I am a life long Green Bay Packer fan and really enjoyed watching <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Packers pummel the Dallas Cowboys<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The enjoyment not so much because I dislike Dallas but more so because Packer&rsquo;s performance was so unexpected. Jordan Love had a perfect passer rating in large part because the receivers caught every ball thrown their way. The offensive line did a fantastic job of opening up holes for Aaron Jones to run through, and the defensive secondary had two interceptions and made it hard on Dak and CeeDee. I don&rsquo;t expect the Packers to have the same success in San Francisco, but they could make the game interesting. My respect for coach Matt LaFleur has gone up tremendously for how the term has performed.</p>
<p>Next came the night cap. I&rsquo;ve lived in metro Detroit for more than half my life, and when Packers play the Lions, I am all cheesehead, otherwise I am rooting for the Lions to win. Those who have grown up a Lions fan have experienced more downs than ups, which I relate to as a Chicago Cubs fan. (Although my Packers were awful during my childhood and teen years during the 70s and 80s.) So, I really wanted to see the Lions win last night, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they hung on to do it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, never trailing in their game. The Lions will have another game this season in Ford Field, and have a good chance to getting in the NFC Championship game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just put it out there. If the Lions win and the Packers beat the 49ers then these two NFC North Division foes would play each other in Ford Field for the right to play in the Super Bowl. Possible, but not probable, but on any given day anything can happen.</p>

			 <p>Back in 2011 when Apple announced the iPad I believed it marked <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the real beginning of the personal computing era<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rather than the beginning of the Post-PC Era as was being pronounced at the time. As <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I argued then<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and think it is still the case, we have historically thought of a personal computer as a device that one person uses. In other words, &ldquo;personal&rdquo; meant one. My argument back then is that &ldquo;personal&rdquo; really should mean what everyone knows it to mean, which is computing specific to you, the user. I imagine personal computing as the mashup of hardware + software + Internet + intelligence.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today I learned<!-- raw HTML omitted --> via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->manton<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rabbit Inc<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. and a mobile device and operating system it has introduced built around a Large Language Model and what the company calls a Large Action Model to provide a user interface based on natural language processing and execute actions rather than generate text and pictures. I don&rsquo;t know whether the NLP works as well is demoed, but the demo at least shows exactly how I imagined how personal computing should work. Speech is our primary mode of interaction and typing is really abnormal and frankly unknown to the majority of people in the world.</p>
<p>I think the software is the most important part of what Rabbit Inc. has made, the purpose of the device is to prove the software&rsquo;s functioning and capability. If it does perform as well as shown, I expect the company and product to be acquired by one of the big tech firms.</p>

			 <p>A lot of attention is being spent on Artificial Intelligence, with most seeing it as the next big technological iteration after mobile Internet access (smartphones), and that might be right. Consequently many are overlooking what the company responsible for that last iteration is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->launching this year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, with Apple&rsquo;s Vision Pro going on sale in stores for $3,499. Much focus is on the hardware, but what one will be able to buy in February is analogous to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the original iPhone<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

			 <p>This article in The Atlantic, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->We’ve Been Thinking About America’s Trust Collapse All Wrong<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Jedediah Britton-Purdy is very good. Too bad it&rsquo;s behind a paywall, but worth trying to read. Here is one of the many important points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another distinction between personal and political trust that we need to learn involves living with sharp moral disagreement. In our own lives, we may refuse to enter close and lasting relationships with people who, say, disagree with us about questions as fundamental as how we should raise our children or what gender roles mean in our family. (I don’t mean that this is necessarily the right approach, and we may lose something when we cut ourselves off from challenge in this way, but the decision is an intelligible one.) But politics is about coexistence with disagreement around issues as fundamental as these, such as abortion. If we treat moral disagreement as proof of moral badness and as a reason, effectively, to cut off civic as well as personal relationships, then politics is done. Politics is a relationship we cannot escape, for better or worse. We can poison it, though, and confusing it with personal relationships that we can refuse or leave is one way of poisoning it.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This article in The Atlantic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> implies that people, many of them Republican, are resigning from Congress due to frustration with getting nothing done. However, I think it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether members of Congress are frustrated, it should matter more whether voters, particularly Republican but Democrat too, are frustrated. I personally think that many people specifically do not want Congress to do anything, they want gridlock, and find the theatre much more entertaining. Too many people vote based on how a person makes them feel or how they want to feel rather than on any facts.</p>

It&rsquo;s a nice search engine, but I don&rsquo;t really see the point of using it to generate pictures or text, particularly on a phone. So far, to me, the best use of generative AI is in natural language processing so that I can verbally control computers without having to use specific syntax or commands.

			 <p>What scares me most about a possible second presidential term for Donald Trump is not Trump himself but rather the fact that for his supporters there is no line that Trump cannot cross at which point he will lose their support. We appear to be split 50/50 in the United States which means that the only way Trump can be held accountable is if members of his own party do so, and that&rsquo;s not just people in Congress but also actual citizens. So, you say you support Trump and you will vote for in November, fine, that is your right, but does that mean you give him a blank check? What can he not do?</p>

That multileveled implication was obvious to first-century members of the Roman Empire because the phrase “Caesar is Lord” was the empire’s loyalty test and political bumper sticker.”</p>

			 <p>“A life that is holy is a life that allows for all of your uncertainties, your curiosities and unbelief. That doesn’t just allow for them but holds them as sacred. Spirituality that is not permitted these liberties is merely subjugation. It is not in protection of the divine; it is in protection of fragile people who are unable to allow spiritual freedoms without their own spirituality feeling threatened. It’s a spirituality that is terrified of meditation for fear of resembling another faith tradition.

			 <p>Over the course of my career the company I work for has provided me a number of different computers to do my job, most of them have been pretty cheap devices. However, for a period of time I was provided with IBM Thinkpads including the 701c that had a unique, expanding, &ldquo;butterfly&rdquo; keyboard. It has been a long time since I have thought about that computer, but today I read <a href="https://blog.jgc.org/2023/12/restoration-of-ibm-thinkpad-701c.html">a description of how one was restored</a>.

			 <p>“We all tend to aim for the goal instead of the journey itself, but spiritually speaking, how we get there is where we arrive. The journey determines the final destination. If we manipulate our way, we end up with a manipulated, self-made god. If we allow ourselves to be drawn and chosen by love, we might just end up with the real God.”</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s another MLB offseason, deep in to December, during which the Chicago Cubs have yet to sign any free agent. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By this time last year<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the Cubs had signed Dansby Swanson after seeing the other top tier free agents go to other teams. Back in November when people were reacting to the Cubs hiring Gregg Counsell as manager <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was skeptical that that hire was a sign that the Cubs were going to be aggressive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the free agent market. I believe that Hoyer most likes Counsell&rsquo;s success without having top tier players, so I expect more of the same. Really. of such free agents only Cody Bellinger remains and I suspect the length of contract he wants is not what Hoyer is willing to give. I don&rsquo;t see the Cubs returning to the World Series as long as Hoyer is in charge.</p>

			 <p>What I like most about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Readwise Reader<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is its support for keyboard shortcuts, just about anything one might want to be done can be done via the keyboard. Unfortunately, support for keyboard shortcuts is highly dependent on Javascript and that seems prone to breakage. It seems about every four months or so the keyboard shortcuts in Reader stop working, and we are in one of those phases. Right now I am seeing shortcuts disappearing just about every time I move from one article to the next, to restore them I have to reload the page. I&rsquo;ve found the problem exists in Chrome and Firefox. I&rsquo;ve sent feedback to Readwise so hope they fix this as they have fixed other occurrences.</p>

			 <p>It is said that what Jesus most often spoke was, do not be afraid, and some claim the United States is a Christian nation, yet those people are driven by fear. Christian nationalism is not about following Christ, it is much the opposite.</p>
<p>“Tyrants thrive in communities of fear. They deceive the fearful into believing they will resolve their agony. They’ll promise safety, power, belonging to those who require their hope be attached to a person, usually a person of status. But as tyrants gain confidence, they have less need to obscure their evil. They learn they can threaten, insult, and abuse their followers directly and openly, past the point of rebuke. They have become salvation to some sect of the community. And in their terror, who would dare rebuke the rescuer?”</p>

			 <p>I think the biggest consequence to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what Om predicts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a potential shift in how we direct young people toward professions that provide for a good life. (aka &ldquo;the American dream&rdquo;). When I grew up, and I think it is still the case, it was implied that the best professions, in most cases defined as the ones for which there is a greatest income potential, are white collar, which are the type of jobs at risk.  The attack on unions starting in the 1980&rsquo;s to just recently implied such &ldquo;blue collar/union&rdquo; jobs are &ldquo;less than&rdquo; non-union, white collar jobs. The huge wealth gap in the United States is a consequence of this direction, which has also transformed the U.S. economy from manufacturing to services. It appears that AI  has the potential to force a re-calibration of what we consider good jobs, ironically through the same automation that eliminated so many blue collar jobs during the last thirty years.</p>

			 <p>I think most people intuitively know the corruptible nature of wealth, and that is why they don&rsquo;t trust any of our institutions. We see any report from a media outlet as simply a vehicle for making money. We believe doctors prescribe drugs that they get paid to push. We believe lawmakers only exist to pass laws for companies from which they have already been paid via lobbyists. Yet, we buy the idea that a corruptible private entity is better than a public one and so we want a government that does nothing in favor of corporations doing everything and consequently we don&rsquo;t favor publicly funded research. In my opinion the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what we saw play out this past month with OpenAI<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is trying to graft the idea of a public good on to a capitalistic entity and that is incompatible because profits will drive every decision.</p>

			 <p>I am reading Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s article in The Atlantic, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Coddling of the American Mind<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I am wondering whether the hypersensitivity to emotional wellbeing Haidt describes can be somewhat attributed to our associating gun violence to mental illness over the last several decades. Mental illnesses are real but I think are diminished when we start tossing out the term as being the cause to all our ills. Perhaps it would not be an issue if we actually did something about mental illness, but I think we mostly talk about it. Our unwillingness to actually address problems and instead simply focus on symptoms is teaching generations of people that symptoms are actually the problems when they are not.</p>
<p>What Haidt does not address in the article is how hypercapitalism, which is the practice in the United States of prioritizing wealth over everything, contributes to the problem. We have many religions in the United States, but I think capitalism is the one that rules them all. The religion of capitalism preaches that there are to be no restraints on one&rsquo;s ability to be wealthy and thus it teaches that the ends justify the means.</p>
<p>Manipulating emotions may be the number one tool of generating wealth in the United States. Marketing and advertising is emotional manipulation for the purpose of selling products, the buying of which produces wealth. Advertising is all about coveting that which another has and thus has existed ever since humans became aware of their surroundings. Technology continually optimizes advertising and today&rsquo;s targeted and viral ads are extremely effective at making us covet.</p>
<p>No popular church nor religion in the United States truly teaches the dangers of wealth. Who preaches and teaches enough is better than more? Heck, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the &ldquo;ministers&rdquo; of many of the most well known churches in the United States are themselves extremely wealthy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Yet, Christianity claims association to Jesus who <!-- raw HTML omitted -->plainly taught<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of these dangers. The consequence is that we live in a society that actually encourages the practice of one profiting off the suffering of another.</p>
<p>Children are immersed practically from the moment of birth in emotions, and our religions teach them how to feel better. The pursuit of happiness is a treadmill for the more and the idea that there is enough for all to be happy is considered un-American. We are frogs floating in warm pot of water and the temperature is increasing toward death.</p>

			 <p>Never before, in my life time, have I seen a person who ran for President of the United States and lost be nominated again by their party for the next election. Practically, once a person has proven to be a loser <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the power of the dollar<!-- raw HTML omitted --> moves on to a different person. In this context one can understand Trump&rsquo;s continued insistence that he won the 2020 election, or at worst Biden stole it, for the sake of being relevant and gaining the money needed for him to run again. It appears many past Republican donors are holding out, probably because they really don&rsquo;t want to waste their money on a loser. Pragmatically their decision will be on whether they become convinced Trump is the only person who can replace Biden, right now it appears they are not so sure.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve come to the belief that religion may be the most dangerous of our instincts because of how it is used by those in power to gain and grow that power. Slavery was justified by religion. The Klu Klux Klan used religion to terrorize, Hitler used religion as the basis for genocide, and we see this cycle through out history onto the present. The &ldquo;fight&rdquo; over and the emergence of Artificial Intelligence is all about power, derived by wealth <!-- raw HTML omitted -->through religion<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. What I fear most about the religions of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->effective altruism and effective accelerationism<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is that their adherents are already extremely powerful, which makes them extremely dangerous. It&rsquo;s not the technology of AI that scares me, it&rsquo;s the people and the religion of those who seek to own it that scare me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The OpenAI saga is a fight between God and Money; between a quite peculiar quasi-religious movement, and a quite ordinary desire to make cold hard cash. You should probably be putting your bets on Money prevailing in whatever strange arrangement of forces is happening as Altman is beamed up into the Microsoft mothership. But we might not be all that better off in this particular case if the forces of God were to prevail, and the rationalists who toppled Altman were to win a surprising victory. They want to slow down AI, which is good, but for all sorts of weird reasons, which are unlikely to provide good solutions for the actual problems that AI generates. The important questions about AI are the ones that neither God or Mammon has particularly good answers for – but that’s a topic for future posts.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel that the big picture behind <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the OpenAI<!-- raw HTML omitted --> saga that occurred over the last fourteen days should be the recognition that the greed inherent in capitalism is dangerous and may ultimately lead to our undoing. We should remember that it is such greed that lead to the Great Depression, and even more recently to the 2008 financial crisis, and frankly is behind much of the current trend to move away from democracy in the United States. Our acceptance of the reality that it&rsquo;s ok for people to profit off the suffering of others lead to big tobacco, the opioid crisis, and the continuing mass murders in the United States. I fear this will all continue so long as we continue to accept that the ends justify the means.</p>

			 <p>I keep reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->articles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that are interpreting the hiring of Gregg Counsell is a sign that the Cubs will be aggressive in the free agent market this year. I believe people might be overlooking something important. Jed Hoyer has stated that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->he has admired Counsell&rsquo;s success<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Milwaukee given the budget constraints. I believe that Hoyer is convinced that his way of NOT paying a lot of money for free agents is the correct path, and signing Counsell enables him to continue that strategy and be successful. Counsell might have signed with the Cubs thinking he is stepping up to a big market team, but in practice the Cubs have more in common with the Brewers. It is more than likely that the Cubs do not sign the likes of Bellinger and Ohtani and instead stick to their history of signing bottom top to top mid tier players. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->None of the players the Cubs signed after hiring Joe Maddon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were top tier at that time, including Jon Lester. Until proven otherwise, I am not convinced the signing of Counsell is a signal of a change in how Hoyer will make decisions. I still think the Cubs fired the wrong man.</p>

			 <p>I realize that what I wrote below and how I relate what the Chicago Cubs have done (sports) to the state of the world may appear to be overly dramatic. What I think is incredible dangerous is a world in which there are no lines, and that is appearing more and more frequently. Some time soon there will be another mass shooting in the United States, this is guaranteed because there is no line, no limit on the amount of death that a gun advocate has in the U.S. to convince them that there is no good reason to have an AK-47. The very principle of liberty for all in the United States, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nor the democratic republic instituted for the sake of that liberty no longer appears to be a line<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

			 <p>I have read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Athletics&rsquo;s articles<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the firing of David Ross and the hiring of Gregg Counsell that confirmed that the decision went down as expected, and no matter how the Cubs front office wants to sugar coat it, they stabbed Ross in the back. Cub fans who have problems seeing this decision as I do likely are in the camp that the ends justify the means. Ends justifying the means is &ldquo;the&rdquo; scourge on our society today in things little like what happened to David Ross and large like the support for and voting for Donald Trump as POTUS. No principles, values, or guard rails (ethics) are considered to be in place that lead one to the conclusion that even though one could do something they won&rsquo;t do it.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Whenever a general manager/front office of a professional sports team fires a good coach, or in baseball manager, I am suspicious of the true motivations behind the decision. I tend to think such decisions are often deflections of attention away from the front office. Today the Chicago Cubs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dismissed David Ross<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and hired Gregg Counsell and many will note similarities in this decision with how they <!-- raw HTML omitted -->dismissed Ricky Renteria in 2014 to hire Joe Maddon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who unexpectedly become available. I personally do not think the two situations are the same.</p>
<p>Renteria had been on the job for only one year, had not really proven himself as a manager, and did not have any history with the Cubs. Ross is one of the heros of the 2016 world championship team and had taken the Cubs to the playoffs as a manager. Counsell is a good manager and had taken the Brewers to the playoffs five of his six seasons with them, but did not have success in the playoffs. I do not think Counsell is as good a manager today as Joe Maddon was in 2014.</p>
<p>More important, David Ross was not the reason why the Cubs did not make the playoffs this season. The Cubs did not make the playoffs because of a depleted bullpen and in my opinion bad offseason acquisitions that were eventually released during the season, and those decisions were made by the general manager and president of baseball operations.</p>
<p>Ricketts might have bought Hoyer&rsquo;s argument that jumping on the opportunity to get Counsell is similar to when Epstein jumped on the opportunity to get Maddon, but if Ricketts really wants to address the root cause for why Cubs did not meet expectations this season he ought to be questioning the decisions made by Hoyer and hold him accountable. If the Cubs have decided to completely move on from 2016 that means moving on from Jed Hoyer. In my opinion, the Cubs released the wrong person from their team.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, if the Cubs make this move of stabbing one of their own in the back, they darn well better be aggressive at signing free agents during the off season.</p>

			 <p>I find <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this to be an interesting debate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of whether or not humans have free will. I think argument made against free will might really be making the argument for how we are all connected. The argument against free will appears predicated on the idea that for it to exist decisions must be able to made without any outside influence, and what that really seems to argue against is randomness. Perhaps the important question isn&rsquo;t whether or not we have free will, but rather, if we don&rsquo;t have free will, then so what?</p>

He gave up the tying home run to Raji Davis in the 8th inning but then came back out in the 9th and held the Indians to no runs with the potential for let down from the 8th inning being huge! The Indians could have walked off in the 9th inning, instead the game played on, the Cubs went ahead in the 10th inning and then won, and Ben Zobrist was named MVP.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From the perspective of my life time of 1966 to present, I think the most consequential change on society has been the rise of conservatism. Today many people claim themselves to be conservative while not being clear what they mean. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> defines conservatism as &ldquo;a cultural, social, and political philosophy that seeks to promote and to preserve traditional institutions, customs, and values.&rdquo; How conservatism is practiced varies among societies.</p>
<p>At the risk of over simplifying, I think Americans who claim to be conservatives mean they are for smaller government, translated to mean lower taxes, lower government spending, and less government involvement in their daily lives. Recently  I think the label has simplified to just mean, not liberal, or &ldquo;Trump supporter.&rdquo;  While some want simply to be left alone and have more agency over their lives, many want to return to some time in the past, such as during the 1950s, when they believed life was better.</p>
<p>I believe conservatives and liberals have an unhealthy obsession with the past. Conservatives want to return to the past, liberals want to correct the past and it seems neither understand that the value of history is to learn from the past for the purpose of not repeating mistakes in the future. I think it is ironic that conservatives and liberals are seen as polar opposites while in reality both are obsessed with the past and neither side has a healthy perspective on progress. In short, you can&rsquo;t really make progress when you are constantly looking in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Can you think of any area of politics that is not about the past? From the age of our government leaders, to how the U.S. constitution is currently used, to why there are wars, to why we cannot decrease the number of mass shootings, work to improve the climate and become healthier, every one of these are only really viewed from the perspective of the past. If most people agree that we should do something about these things, why can&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>The current obsession with polarization means more interest is in the argument rather than progress. I am not sure either side really wants progress because whenever either one has the ability to make progress disagreements within their ranks prevents it from happening. Polarization is focused on getting one&rsquo;s way and beating the other and lost is any amount progress that in past times was born out of debate between the two points of view.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to have different ideas for how progress is to be made, or even what is progress, and another to not want to progress at all. Right now the United States has no desire for progress, we see this in how everything of significance is being handled in the world. I think how we got here is born out of a belief, more shared than we like to realize, that humanity cannot really improve itself. Too many now think the world cannot be better for future generations so it&rsquo;s not even worth trying. So long American dream. No wonder why Gen Z is pissed of at all older generations and considers everything they say as b.s., and we are seeing the consequences playing out.</p>
<p>Consequently, why bother with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->empathy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? I don&rsquo;t need to consider how events affect you, the other, when I know how they affect me. Without empathy there is no way to love my neighbor, nor see my neighbor as a part of myself, I only need to know the world through my own feelings and state of being.  In fact, they aren&rsquo;t neighbors, most are enemies. No need to imagine a better world and the hope that inspires, rather one&rsquo;s imagination only produces nightmares.</p>
<p>Humanity is driving itself toward extinction, what only seems open to debate is how, destruction incrementally via climate change, or suddenly via nuclear war?  It always has taken work and the desire to co-exist with and even love the other with whom we share space with on this planet. What is certain is destruction will happen while we are only looking in the rear view mirror and not through the windshield toward the future. Humanity is so diverse that there will never be agreement on which turns to take along the road, but surely we can agree it is desirable to move forward!</p>

			 <p>I understand <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the frustration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that Dodger, Braves, and Orioles fans feel right now, their teams won divisions and had the best season records but are no longer playing for the World Series championship. Once something different, the World Series today is a tournament, and the season records are merely tickets for entry into the tournament and the scheduling of opponents and games. Every tournament format of every sport brings to the fore the hottest team at the moment, which is not necessarily the best team of the field.  Tournaments exist because they generate a lot of money and do so because of Cinderella stories.  March Madness, the NCAA men&rsquo;s basketball tournament, basically funds the entire NCAA. My recommendations to fans are, first recognize your team just only won opportunity to play in the tournament, and next, make note of how well the team is playing in the weeks leading up to the start of the tournament. Finally, consider the possibility that the real best teams might be the ones capable of overcoming what others might claim are disadvantages.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read some common themes regarding <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google&rsquo;s change to seven years of full support for Android on the Pixel 8 phones<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The comments boil down to whether the hardware performance will keep up or whether people really use a phone for that long. (Others are skeptical that Google will live up the promise, but I think if they don&rsquo;t they will face lawsuits.) I think both are examples of missing the point. For me there is a difference between having the ability to use a phone that runs current software for more than three years and a circumstance where I must replace the phone after three years if I want current software. Most likely there will be new features in the Pixel 10 or 11 that make buying a new phone desirable but there is a big difference between wanting to buy a new phone and having to buy a new phone. I would be very surprised to find many people still using the Pixel 8 seven years from now, but it&rsquo;s nice to know they can if they want to.</p>

			 <p>If you <a href="https://kottke.org/23/10/america-is-quickly-becoming-more-nonreligious">think you are not religious</a> then you don&rsquo;t know what is religion. I think Americans are more religious today than ever before, but don&rsquo;t recognize it because we equate religion with a specific association to specific organizations or specific beliefs in deities.</p>
<p>Religion is much more fundamental to who we are as humans. For example, if you identify yourself with an NFL team, like I say I am a Packers fan, you are religious. The religion, which is that to which you connect or bind yourself (re-ligio) is professional U.S. football. Republicans? Democrat? Conservative? Liberal? Progressive? All religions. Yes, even atheism is a religion. Religion is an aspect of our ego.</p>
<p>The problem in all of this is we have no understanding of our true selves, and the decisions we make are to maintain all these false selves that don&rsquo;t really add value to who we are and what we truly need. It is the stranglehold of our religions that is driving decisions that we make against our own best interests.</p>

			 <p>I am not as crazy as to pretend that I can predict what will happen in this year&rsquo;s Major League Baseball playoffs, but I did want to go down on record about what are my preferences given that the Chicago Cubs are not in the tournament.</p>
<p>Given I closely follow the Cubs, I am more emotionally invested in the National League games, so I will start with the easy part, which is that my preference for the American League champion is any team other than Houston. Houston has won it recently, most of the others have not, and that is the bottom line. For some reason I find myself drawn to the Baltimore Orioles, so I will prefer they play in the Word Series for the American League.</p>
<p>Wild card teams seem to excel in the tournament and do so at the expense of the higher seeds who are division winners. I think the wild card teams have the advantage of actually having played under playoff pressure for weeks up to the tournament just to make it in to the postseason.  Of the the wild card teams, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the Arizona Diamondbacks made it to the NLCS, and I think a championship between them and Atlanta would be very fun to watch.</p>
<p>My emotional preference is for Philadelphia to represent the NL in the World Series because of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kyle Schwarber<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I expect Atlanta to make it to the World Series and win it all because they are the best team in all of baseball. A big part of me likes the idea of Schwarber having the most success of the former Cub players after the 2016 World Series given how the Cubs front office gave up on him waaaay too soon.</p>

			 <p>I use Drummer to write many of my posts for micro.blog. I wonder what happens when I delete a post way back in the past?

I do know that I have to specify in my blog settings the public URL for the outline file, so it looks like the script in Drummer let&rsquo;s micro.blog know a change has been made to the OPML file and then I assume micro.blog reads the file. As I can edit posts in Drummer and publish the edits back to micro.blog, there is the appearance of a mapping of outline nodes to blog posts. I have found that I can even edit posts that I wrote way back in October 2021. The key question is, what does it do to deletions of entire posts? Manton confirmed that micro.blog does not delete posts removed from an OPML file.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking back at it<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the last week of the MLB baseball season is often been filled with angst. I do agree with what I wrote back in 2019, I&rsquo;d rather be in the position of being disappointed that a good team did not succeed than always rooting for bad teams who occasionally surprise. The Cubs lost last night after having a 6-0 lead. In many ways the game encapsulates their current state, some good pitching to gain a lead or stay close, but not enough pitching to sustain the lead through 9 innings. In that state all other facets of the game have to be played near flawlessly, so a fielding error can (and last night was) be fatal. Good news is that the one loss does not put them out of the playoff standings, but they cannot lose two games in a row now and when they do lose they are at the mercy of how other teams perform.</p>

			 <p>Cubs starter Justin Steele got pounded by Pirates last night, and the Cubs lost 7-13. Fortunately, the Marlins also lost so the Cubs maintain the half game lead for the third wild card. My buddy said he thinks the Cubs pitching staff has nothing left in the tank, and that certainly looked to be the case last night. Steele is the best of the Cubs pitchers and he was cruising until he hit an apparent wall in the fourth inning.</p>

			 <p>The World Series, like most major sports championships, is won by defense. In baseball that mainly translates to pitching, but also fielding. When you play the same team in a playoff series your hitters usually face the opponent&rsquo;s best pitching, consequently you should plan for 3 or fewer runs scored and that means you want your pitching to hold the opponent to 3 or fewer runs.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of September the Cubs have been in playoff games. Nearly all of the teams they faced need to beat them to move ahead of the Cubs in the Wild Card playoff standings. By my count the Cubs have played 17 games so far in September and in 7 of them their opponent scored 3 or fewer runs. My conclusion is that the Cubs pitching is simply not good enough to win in the playoffs.</p>
<p>I think my conclusion holds if you look at the larger body of work over the season. I expect that in a high percentage of the games the Cubs won they scored 4 or more runs, too many of those they needed to score 4 or more runs. During the regular season it is not surprising that your hitters will have more success because they will be in many situations where they face poor pitching.</p>
<p>A team built to win in the MLB playoffs has the pitching that more often than not can hold their opponent to 3 or fewer runs. Truth is the Cubs got through the 2023 season with only one reliable starting pitcher, maybe two (Steele for sure, and possibly Hendricks). Stroman and Taillon have not been consistent and Taillon has been aweful. Javier Assad joined the starting rotation too late in to the season so it is really hard to assess his reliability. The bullpen is no better, only Merrywather and Alzolay has been reliable, though Leiter is borderline.</p>
<p>The fact that the Cubs are in a playoff race is much more important this year than they actually make the playoffs, and the goal long term is be winning division championships and not gain a playoff berth via the wild card. While at the beginning of the season there was some hope the Cubs could compete with the Brewers for the NL Central division championship, I think it was evident early on through head to head games with the Brewers that this Cubs team is not as good or better than the Brewers. Sure, the Cubs can win any game, but can they win a series?</p>
<p>Bottom line, the Chicago Cubs are on schedule for their long term goals of winning division titles and the World Series in upcoming years. Clearly, the Cubs need to improve their pitching. Jordan Wicks has shown he is a piece of the puzzle for next year, and we can hope Taillon will return to the how he pitched in the past. Stroman might be back, but with Hendricks being another year older I think the Cubs need to sign at least two reliable starting pitchers during the off season as well as keep Merryweather.</p>
<p>From the lineup perspective, I think the Cubs should be aggressive in their attempt to sign Bellinger, but I doubt he stays and his departure will create a big gap in their lineup. Maybe youngsters Morel, Mervis, or Crow-Armstrong can help fill that gap but all are too inexperienced with MLB pitching. Consequently, the Cubs need to sign at least one big-name hitter to maintain their current starting lineup performance.</p>
<p>Finally, the biggest question of the off season might be whether David Ross has what it takes to manage a championship caliber baseball team. Every manager makes questionable lineup and in-game decisions, and this is Ross' first manager job so we need to keep in mind that he is learning on the job. I personally can&rsquo;t pin the current Cubs situation on Ross, the bottom line is that the players have to perform and they are not performing. Ross has made lineup changes and pitching changes, as far as I can tell he is doing everything he can to try and have the Cubs win games. I would not be in a hurry to replace Ross unless there is a championship experienced person to replace him. So, David Ross' fate, like Rick Renteria&rsquo;s was in 2015, may be decided more by who is available rather than by his own performance.</p>
<p>I am frustrated by and mad about the Cub&rsquo;s performance this month, but I am mostly mad at the Cubs veterans who have under performed with the pressure on. Frankly, if it weren&rsquo;t for Suzuki the Cubs would probably would have a longer losing streak. Swanson, Bellinger, and Happ have not met expectations as the veteran leaders. In the big picture I am happy about where the Cubs are, they met my expectations for this season and look to be on track of near year and beyond. All of the younger Cub players who have never been in this position of a playoff race in September are gaining valuable experience of how to deal with the pressure, and in my opinion experience matters most.</p>

			 <p>We are at the start of the second to the last week of the 2023 Major League Baseball season with the Chicago Cubs in the midst of a five game losing streak. Last week has been frustrating and hopefully behind us. The Cubs have played themselves out of any chance of winning the NL Central and have moved to a third place tie with the Florida Marlins in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Wild Card standings<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, trailing the Diamondbacks, who just swept the Cubs, by a half game. Disappointed as I am, I also know in the big picture this experience is good for the future of the team, and should be a pleasant surprise considering how bad the team as at the beginning of June.</p>

Problem was at the time it first started being sold it ran a year old version of Android and never got current. It was clear early on that Microsoft was not committed to it.</p>
<p>Last year I bought a Duo for just under $300, nearly $1,000 less than it first cost. At that price, it&rsquo;s a nice device though too heavy to be an every day carry.  I find it most useful for monitoring my two fantasy football teams on Sundays.</p>
<p>Recently Microsoft announced they will not be providing updates, so its now an orphan.</p>

			 <p>America has never truly been a democracy, it has always been an oligarchy behind the mask of &ldquo;representative democracy.&rdquo;  A group of rich, white men declared their independence from a rich white man. The rich white men founded a ruling class (government) that established liberty for their ability to remain rich and their only concern for others was to the extent that they supported their cause. Ironically, because America was the first to form something that looked like self-government over time other countries used the U.S. Constitution as the blueprint for founding their own democracies. However, it appears that none of those countries established their constitutions for the purpose of securing an oligarchy, and so <!-- raw HTML omitted -->over time they made reforms to be more democratic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The United States has not made such reforms to dismantle the oligarchy and so life in the U.S. goes on as intended for the benefit of a minority of wealthy people. Problem is, demographics and generations change and so there are ways for reform to occur within our current form of government, which is why I think conservatives are fighting so hard because they feel if they don&rsquo;t take action their control will cease.</p>

			 <p>The 162 game schedule is a big part of what makes Major League Baseball unique among professional sports in the United States because it tends to force differences in how games are approached throughout the season. No team is ever going to be undefeated, the current best team, the Atlanta Braves, has won a little over 65% of their games. The MLB season is a marathon meaning that in most cases a game is not treated as &ldquo;must win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oddly, while a long schedule means most games are not &ldquo;must win,&rdquo; for some teams, earlier than they would like, the season transitions to &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they win or lose&rdquo; because they are out of playoff contention. As a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan it has been my experience more often than not that the Cubs are out of playoff contention by the end of May or early June. Further, as a lifelong Cubs fan, I have learned it is much more fun watching games year after year when the team is playing meaningful games in September. I would much rather have the team lose in the playoffs every year than have the team out the playoffs by June in the majority of seasons.</p>
<p>So, in baseball, a transition occurs over the course of a season where teams move from playing to win games to playing to must win games. The benefit of expanding the number of playoff teams is that more teams start playing more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games in September than in years past. In my experience, teams with players who have the most experience winning &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games are best positioned for long term success.</p>
<p>As an aside, it should be obvious why wild card teams, which have worse records than division winners, have had so much success in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s because they usually play more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games during the last month of the season and through that gain valuable experience and confidence. Turns out there is a big difference between &ldquo;wanting to win&rdquo; and &ldquo;needing to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point of a long 2023 season, the Chicago Cubs are starting the transition in to &ldquo;must win&rdquo; territory. Nobody associated with the Cubs is going to admit publicly that the games they are playing this week and next are must win, but it&rsquo;s a mistake if they don&rsquo;t start viewing the games as such, in fact they ought to embrace the transition. As Billy Jean King is often <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quoted as saying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &ldquo;Pressure is a privilege.&rdquo; The pressure of being in &ldquo;must win&rdquo; mode as the calendar flips from August to September is a badge of success.</p>
<p>The unpredictable nature of sports mean should the Cubs make the playoffs they could win the World Series. The probability of the 2023 Cubs winning the World Series is not high, not like it was for the 2016 team. However, the experience of playing as many &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games as possible over the course of the final month of the season is huge! The Cubs are exactly where they hoped to be at this time of the season and now players who have not had the experience with this type of pressure gain the experience that will provide dividends for years beyond.</p>
<p>I was mad the Cubs were crushed by the Brewers last night because I desire the immediate gratification of winning the N.L. Central this year, but I am happy that the young Cubs players such as their current best starting pitcher, Justin Steele, are getting this experience playing these games. However, the full value of that experience will not be realized if the team, from top to bottom, doesn&rsquo;t consider these games &ldquo;must win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 2023 MLB Season is transitioning from &ldquo;would like to win&rdquo; to &ldquo;must win&rdquo; for the Cubs, and I am looking for the team to embrace the pressure.</p>

			 <p>I agree with most of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what David Brooks writes here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but I do think he is missing some context. The main societal change of my life time has been the rise of conservatism, mainly via the Reagan presidency, but you can probably trace that back further to post World War II and the establishment of the U.S. political and capitalistic empire. The political empire demands the United States stands alone as the most powerful nation on earth, the capitalistic empire demands that citizens are responsible for themselves so that there is no redistribution of wealth.</p>

<p>To figure out how to get the country past its current impasse, we need to look at reality as it is, not as we imagine it might be.

That may be unpleasant for Brooks — and all of us — to contemplate, but reality’s ugliness doesn’t provide an excuse for ignoring it.</p>

			 <p>I am seeing lots of articles about the demise of the PAC-12 college conference. To an older guy such as myself I find the current conference names no longer make sense.

So, I say you might as well just change the conference names.</p>
<p>One thing I do wonder, with the PAC-12 disbanded what of the Rose Bowl? While the CFB championship long ago broke the Big Ten/PAC-12 match ups, they did try to hold to that when not hosting  the championship. Now what?</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The game last night<!-- raw HTML omitted --> encapsulates why it has been frustrating to follow the Chicago Cubs this season. They have the hitting to put up a huge number of runs and the pitching to enable them to win, but as prone they are to score 20 runs in one night, today they might score only 2. Too many losing streaks up to this season has prevented them from being in first place right now. Good new is that they have more games against the Brewers and Reds that enable them to close the gap.</p>

			 <p>The Chicago Cubs winning streak ended at eight games today with a loss to the Cardinals in the last game of the season against their division rival. (Let that sink in a moment, thanks due to the new &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; MLB schedule.) Obviously, the streak had to end eventually, but the Cards have proven to be very beatable and we had every reason to expect the Cubs to win today too. Tomorrow night the Cubs start a four game series against the Reds at home, and they need to win the first game as they can no longer afford losing streaks. Even more importantly, the Cubs are 3.5 games behind the Reds in the NL Central standings and we do not want to fall further behind. The Cubs have an opportunity to pull closer to the Reds and Brewers this week and therefore solidify being in the hunt for the remainder of the season. Losing 3 out of 4 of these games against the Reds might actually be too difficult to overcome. Ross needs to be putting the best lineup in every game for this series, I do not want to see Mancini at first and Morel in place other than DH. Play Gomes in all of these games. Cubs need to treat this series like the playoffs!</p>

			 <p>The Chicago Cubs beat St. Louis last night and evened their record to 51-51, and sit at 5.5 games behind first place in the NL Central and 4 games back in the Wild Card. In short, a better record and potential than last year. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sell off really didn&rsquo;t happen last year<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but this year there is much debate about what they should do with Cody Bellinger and Marcus Stroman, both who are really good but with whom the Cubs lose contract control at the end of the season.

I say they should keep both Bellinger and Stroman and make serious intent to sign them at the end of the season. The farm system is not in dire need of prospects.</p>

			 <p>I am resigned to the fact that Chicago Cubs are not going to be a playoff team this year, which makes them sellers for the upcoming trade deadline, and it is this idea of &ldquo;selling&rdquo; that makes me mad. We knew that Cody Bellinger was only going to be with the Cubs for a year and if he played to any amount of his capability would be a mid season trade, so his leaving is not a problem. What I don&rsquo;t want to see is the Cubs trading Marcus Stroman.</p>
<p>Starting pitching is the foundation of a MLB team and the Cubs have no real pitching prospects in their farm system. Every free agent pitcher not on their team that the Cubs sign is an unknown. Jameson Taillon is the most recent case in point, the Cubs didn&rsquo;t really know what they were getting when they signed Taillon but they hoped he would be as good as he was in previous seasons. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you sign a player not on your team you hope they will perform as you expect, but hope is not a strategy! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Stroman has been the best Cubs pitcher the last two years. You can make the claim he is one of the best pitchers in baseball and the Cubs should know best about his health, his mental make up, and his skills. In other words, Stroman is a known asset, and when you are building a team I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->general managers should bias what they know about the players on their team<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>If the Cubs trade Stroman, to me that not only means this season (2023) is down the drain, it is also that they are not closer to making the playoffs in 2024. What such a trade tells me is that the Cubs continue to tread mediocrity and have no real plan for returning to the playoffs. Further, if the Cubs trade Stroman and thus are sellers at the deadline ownership must make a change in the front office and the manager. I don&rsquo;t think Hoyer has any real idea how to build the team, he is just hoping to improve, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hope is not a plan.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The &ldquo;buyers and sellers&rdquo; phenomenon is not good for Major League Baseball. The way teams treat free agency is destroying how they build their teams and farm systems for continued success. Now, because most teams in baseball are not very good, most teams are unloading their best players mid season for prospects that might never make it to the majors or at best won&rsquo;t be on their team until 3 years down the road. Every off season teams buy a bunch of free agents (basically creating new rosters every year), all who are unknowns, and hope they perform well enough to form a competitive team. Most teams find their hopes were ill conceived and they rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>Put it another way, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nearly all MLB general managers are doing their job no differently than fantasy baseball managers<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Problem is, fantasy baseball is not the real world. MLB does not build rosters based on a draft of the entire pool of available players. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right now the Cubs, and most MLB teams, are building new rosters each year from a small pool of unknowns<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I am looking for leadership from the Cubs with a real plan and the funding from ownership to stick to the plan. It is looking more to me that Hoyer does not have a real plan and Ricketts has to find another person to run team who has a plan, otherwise he is no better than all prior owners of the Chicago Cubs.</p>

			 <p>In my opinion, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the debate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> over whether or not the COVID-19 pandemic leaked from a lab or naturally occurred keeps missing the real issue of the U.S. response, which is that Republicans, particularly the Trump administration, politicized the event. National emergencies like a pandemic that can, and did, result in the deaths of millions of people, should not be used for political gain or handled to minimize political risk. At a time like this the President of the United states has to stop being a politician and govern in a manner that treats all citizens of all political party affiliations the same way. Trump always analyzed very single aspect of COVID-19 through the lens of how it hurts or helps him politically. COVID-19 killed Republicans and Democrats equally. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The very investigations going on right now about COVID-19 are still politically motivated, and that is the real problem!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chrissy Stoop writes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the strongest promoters of Christian Nationalism are the church going true believers. I think that Evangelicals have unwittingly embraced the true founding of Christianity, which was to consolidate power in the Roman Empire under Caesar. Constantine, not Jesus, founded the Christian religion of what nearly every person who claims the identity, Jesus on the other hand started something very different. Oh, and by the way, the first amendment is more about preventing government from using religion to enforce tyranny than it is about allowing people to discriminate on religious grounds. The founders were not what one today would call Bible believers but they had seen how the powerful used religion in Europe to rule over others.</p>

			 <p>I am a life long Chicago Cubs fan, and so that gives me the perspective of comparing the current Cubs teams to those of the past. The 2023 edition of the Chicago Cubs is frustrating because there is so much <a href="https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2023/7/1/23780818/2023-cubs-heroes-and-goats-game-80">talent on the team that is not living up to its potential</a>, and the result is very inconsistent play. Simply put, the Cubs lose too many games in a row. Really good teams don&rsquo;t lose more than two games in a row, whereas the Cubs often fall in to a streak of losing 3 or more games in a row, the result is an attempt to move up in standings is like being in quick sand.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dan Seifert writing for The Verge<!-- raw HTML omitted --> provides an interesting comparison between the Samsung Z Fold and the Pixel Fold. Samsung&rsquo;s foldable is optimized for portrait orientation while the Pixel Fold is oriented around landscape. I note that the Surface Duo has a similar design perspective, and the consequence is better single screen, phone-like usage. Seifert&rsquo;s opinion is that one buys a foldable for the inside screen thus Samsung&rsquo;s approach may be better. I agree that portrait is right for small screen tablets, but I understand Google&rsquo;s approach to making sure there is a good phone experience. What I wonder is, how does the Kindle app look in portrait on the Pixel Fold?</p>

			 <p>Lately I have been ruminating on generational differences in relationship to technology. Like all things, technology changes over time. I remember a time before cell phones, when the only way to make a phone call was to by using a handset in our home, but I don&rsquo;t remember a time when there were no phones. Generations younger than mine do not know of a time when cell phones did not exist. Today <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Winer writes<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a similar technology change, between black and white and color television.</p>
<p>The differences between those who lived during &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; periods and &ldquo;never knew anything else&rdquo; periods of technology can have significant societal consequences. I think the Internet is one such case, with those who have never lived without the Internet expecting all matters related to time happening much faster than my generation and older who grew up without the Internet. The &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; generation will not tolerate society changes needing to take tens or hundreds of years of time (civil rights, women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights, etc..) to complete, they expect such change to happen in months if not days!</p>

It seems most people believe that a President can and should be able to simply make changes and that would make that person a king against which we declared our independence. Consequently, any person in power is going to encounter oppositional power and how that person handles it is an important skill. So, RFK Jr. has some opinions about affects of vaccines on autism, which he is certainly allowed to have, but what will he do with them? How does he view those who disagree with his opinions, with contempt or as an opponent? Too many people treat others with contempt and that is counter productive.</p>

The strategy for the NL Central should be to maintain at least a .500 record and you will have a chance to win the division come September, and based on that the Cubs being 6 games below .500 is a concern, but plenty of time to make it up as long as they keep winning series. Unfortunately, today the Cubs start a series against the Baltimore Orioles who are a better team with a 43-25 record. If the Cubs can win this series, they then travel to Pittsburgh for another three game series and an opportunity to make up ground. It&rsquo;s not too early to emphasize the importance of winning a series, and I think this one with the Orioles is an important one.</p>

			 <p>I like sharing pictures on this blog and I wish that micro.blog had a simple way for creating photo albums. I just returned from a trip and I would love to be able to upload pictures that I took during the trip to a separate page that I can just link to rather than post all the pictures to the main blog page. What I desire is to batch upload a bunch of photos, be prompted for a date and place and have the software automatically make a photo page. The only photos plug-ins involve changes to the &ldquo;default&rdquo; photos page or converting a blog to something like Instagram.</p>
<p>I am not very sophisticated in managing my photos, they upload automatically to Google Photos and I use Syncthing to make a local backup. I can, and do, make albums in Google Photos, which used to be made automatically but no longer do.</p>

			 <p>Is it me, or does some hotel cancellation policies feel like a scam? What I am seeing is to be able to cancel as late as 24 hours before some hotels are charging $50 or more a night. Some times it’s worse. I made a reservation at a hotel a few weeks back that only allows free cancellation up until a week before the check in date, no matter the price, and that just seems wrong. I wanted to pay less per night in comparison to other hotels, so I made the reservation with the sinking feeling Murphy would get me, and he did as I had to cancel today, which is check in day and that would have cost me the same cancellation fee if I cancelled two days ago.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/06/02/first-impressions-of.html">First Impressions Of The Google Pixel 7a</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/06/02/first-impressions-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-06-02 16:58:03 -0400">Jun 2, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Google announced and began selling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Pixel 7a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> earlier last month, and I ordered a Sea colored version from Amazon about a week later. The Pixel 7a is replacing the Pixel 4a that has been my everyday carry phone for the last three years. I really like the size and feel of the Pixel 4a and so I was not eager to up-size to the newer phone, but it has come to the end of the road with Android and there are features the 7a has that make the upgrade a &ldquo;no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My main concern about the Pixel 7a has been its size and glossy back. The Pixel 7a is taller than the Pixel 4a and because of that I find it harder to operate with one hand. The weight, however, is the most noticeable difference. I am finding that due to the weight it is more comfortable holding the phone in my left hand, but in a position where I can&rsquo;t scroll apps with that same hand and as a result this phone requires more two hand operation than the Pixel 4a. The weight and size difference is also noticeable when I put the Pixel 7a in a front pant pocket. Fortunately, the size do not make these use cases impossible, just different and I suspect the difference will become less noticeable over time.</p>
<p>The back of the Pixel 7a is more &ldquo;polished&rdquo; than the Pixel 4a, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel so slippery that I fear it is going to quickly slip out of my hand. I purchased a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really nice Latercase<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone.</p>
<p>Battery life appears to be better, but I don&rsquo;t know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accubattery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%. Battery life is an item that requires a longer duration to evaluate.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is just me, but I think pictures using the wide angle lens have a bit of a fish eye affect. (See the last picture on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for an example.) I don&rsquo;t think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras.</p>
<p>I really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast.</p>
<p>As I expected, it was a real pain to move the Pixel Watch from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google really does not understand what is a technology ecosystem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it&rsquo;s not just a suite of products that have the same appearance, it&rsquo;s products that work together with little effort by the user. The fact that one has to factory reset a WearOS watch to move it from one Pixel phone to another is the clearest evidence of Google&rsquo;s cluelessness when it comes to tech ecosystems. At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work.</p>
<p>Of the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it&rsquo;s best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery. Seems to me though that Google intends users to keep the phone on the stand, so you would think they would incorporate programming to help with the battery health.</p>
<p>Over all I am happy with the Pixel 7a. It&rsquo;s larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the &ldquo;A Series&rdquo; pixel phones, but it&rsquo;s not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the &ldquo;small, medium, and large&rdquo; sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phone is to get a larger screen. I really hope that Google keeps a phone that is no larger than 6-inches tall.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/bernie-sanders-debt-ceiling-bill">agree with Bernie</a>. After Biden signs the debt ceiling bill he should file suite against Congress asking the Supreme Court to declare the debt ceiling as an unconstitutional violation of the 14th amendment. The budget process is the time at which Congress set what spending it will or will not do, and Government cannot stop paying its bill it already decided in the budget to take on the cost.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with Bernie that Biden should rather than signing this bill declared the 14th amendment gives him the authority to pay the bills. The 11th hour is not the time to introduce such uncertainty, but raising the case to SCOTUS immediately after word so that there is enough time for process is the right thing to do.</p>

			 <p>Everyone wants the government to spend less. Politicians threaten to destroy the full faith and credit of the United States with claims they desire to cut spending. Logically, if you seriously want to cut spending you do so by cutting where you most spend money, and <a href="https://popular.info/p/there-is-always-more-money-for-defense">the U.S. government spends the vast majority of the money we give in taxes on the military</a>. The government makes incremental cuts on non-military programs that actually help citizens that are never intended to be consequential, while at the same time spending more in the area in which they spend the most, the military.</p>

			 <p>When I read something about the dangers of AI I can&rsquo;t help but fear the writers are missing an important point. Saying that AI is bad is like saying the Internet is bad or guns are bad. In truth none of these items are bad. What is bad, and what we need to focus on, is that there are bad people who can and will use these items to amplify what they can do and thus inflict harm on others.</p>
<p>Back before the Internet was known by most of the world those who supported it advocated for all of the good it can do, but we failed to take in to account how it can be used for harm. What is common among AI, the Internet, and guns, particularly automatic guns, is the scale and speed at which harm can be done.</p>
<p>So, my advice is, focus a bit less on the technology and more on the ways in which people want and might use that technology for harm and then craft policies aimed at constraining the the people who may do that harm. It might be making a nuanced argument, but I think it is an important one when encountering those who see themselves as needing to defend/protect the items.</p>

			 <p>One of the unwritten rules of tech is the idea that more is better, the purpose of which is to have us continually buy the latest generation of a product. The rule began with the model year releases of automobiles and became adopted by the tech industry. Unfortunately, we consumers don&rsquo;t often enough question whether the latest features really do matter. We aren&rsquo;t helped by tech reviewers who often seem to advocate more for the tech industry than consumers. An example that I am thinking about is the push for faster refresh rates on smartphones.</p>
<p>If you have read smartphone reviews over the last year or so you have probably been convinced that phones with 60Hz refresh screens are bad and really should be avoided. We all should be clamoring for 120Hz or at least 90Hz screens so that we get the fastest, smoothest screen scrolling. Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?</p>
<p>Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited,&rdquo; 60Hz screen as my daily driver. When I got the new Pixel 7a I dutifully changed the setting, as prescribed by nearly all tech reviewers, to turn on Smooth Display so that it displays at 90Hz. Every reviewer who directs one to make this change intones something to the affect, &ldquo;why is Smooth Display not enabled by default?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I can say, yes, after turning on Smooth Display scrolling text up/down on the Pixel 7a is faster, what nobody seems to ask is, on a 6-inch display, does one really need that scrolling to be faster? I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not. Increase the size of the screen to perhaps the 11-inch standard tablet, or larger, and I can see how faster refresh can really matter, but on a 6-inch screen?</p>
<p>Another example, at least to me, is the &ldquo;insistence&rdquo; that we all need 5G wireless data on our phones. Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen? For example, I streamed video on the Pixel 7a and it looked no better to me than on the Pixel 4a. Again, if I were on a tablet or certainly a PC then I would likely benefit by the faster transfer rate, but I doubt that 5G is really going to make difference on the Pixel 7a.</p>
<p>To be fair, I do gain some benefits in the upgrade from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. I am finding the front, under-screen finger print scanner is much better than the back scanner of the 4a. The camera is much better and thus I am getting better pictures. Battery life seems to be better, probably thanks to a larger battery and the Tensor G2 chip, and I am happy to finally have the convenience of wireless charging.</p>
<p>Truth is, we likely reached peak smartphone many years ago, therefore there are really fewer needed new features that really matter, and consequently there is a need for more marketing to get people to buy phones. If you are wondering why Google will be selling the Pixel Fold, the reason why is because the smartphone &ldquo;industry&rdquo; is convinced such foldables are needed in order to keep selling phones over the next ten years. (The main case for foldables is people want to carry smaller devices, but ironically that could be served by selling phones with smaller screens!) In my opinion, the only change in smartphones that we really need is in battery life, and the technical problem of gaining more battery life from the same size batteries appears to be impossible to overcome. Ironically, one way to improve battery life is to set the screen refresh to 60Hz and use slower file transfer speeds, but then we could get by with last year&rsquo;s phone.</p>

			 <p>I have now replaced two Pixel phones with a newer model and each time I do I am astounded by how little Google understands technology ecosystems. Not only does Google require physically connecting the two phones together with a cable to transfer data, but to transfer a WearOS watch, like the Pixel Watch, from one phone to another you have to factory reset the watch. Seriously! Does anyone at Google ever even try moving from one generation phone to another?</p>
<p>Google seems to think that when one buys a new Pixel phone they are going to buy a new watch too. The factory reset of the watch would not be so bad if one could restore the watch like one can with a Pixel phone, but Google does not provide a backup of WearOS watches to their cloud.</p>
<p>Here is the process for one who owns a Pixel Watch paired with a Pixel 4a to replace the phone with a Pixel 7a. You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the &ldquo;old&rdquo; phone.</p>
<p>Over the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets. Apple has been doing this for many years, and honestly, I do not understand why Google, with all of its technical brilliance cannot figure out how to make this process of transfering from one model Pixel phone to another as pain free as possible.</p>
<p>So, once you have the phone set it comes time to pair the Pixel Watch to the new phone. The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything. Oh, and neither the Google Play store nor the Google Watch app keep track of what apps or watch faces you install on the watch, so you have figure out what to install! Anyone at Google who does such a transfer finds this acceptable ought to be embarrased, it might be the most brain dead process of all of technology!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like nobody at Google has figured it out. Transferring the Pixel Buds Pro from the Pixel 4a to the 7a works exactly how one expects, and how transferring a watch should work. No reset, no pairing, no manual configuration, just take the buds out of the case, put them in my ear, and they just work on the new phone!</p>
<p>Like the Pixel Buds, the Pixel Watch is an accessory to Pixel Phones, but the WearOS, Android, and Pixel teams seem to think the Pixel Watch is a standalone device. Sure, one can buy a watch with an LTE radio and with it and the built-in GPS the watch can function apart from the phone, but honestly, most users are not buying watches with LTE radios. Even if they do, the process of using the Play Store app on the watch to find and install apps is best described as tedious.</p>
<p>The worst part of the WearOS apps process is that Google actually had it right the first time it released their smartwatch operating system. When Google first released a smartwatch there was no way to install apps directly on the watch, you had to use the phone, and the companion app on the phone made it easy to manage the apps to install. Back then while recovering from a factory reset did not automatically restore the watch, it at least put all the apps you had installed in one spot so that you could manually trigger the installation.</p>
<p>For all the progress Google has made over the years to improve Android, Pixel phones, and develop the Pixel Watch, the lack of emphasis on making the products work together seamlessly is a huge let down. Given there have been now been several iterations of Android, WearOS, and Pixel phones, there is no excuse for why the transfer process so brain dead. What I see is a lack of diligence and a willingness to accept things that are not good enough, and I have to question whether such a company unwilling to do things right ought to be trusted playing with technology such as Artificial Intelligence that could be dangerous.</p>

The deep irony is that the very argument made by many against gun regulation, &ldquo;first Hitler came for their guns&hellip;,&rdquo; leads to inaction, more violence, and more willingness to give up freedom for the sake of safety.</p>

			 <p>If I were in charge of <a href="https://wired.trib.al/rTNlws1">marketing a foldable phone</a>, I think I would call it a mobile 2-in-1 rather than foldable because that puts emphasis on the functionality. From using the original Surface Duo learned that you have to think of these devices as a small tablet first and a smartphone second.</p>
<p>I could be a target consumer for these devices because I am a heavy tablet user and a lite phone user, and I use both devices every day. The problem is, no foldable is ever going to be as thin as a standard smartphone and feel comfortable in front pants pockets.</p>
<p>Price is a real constraint right now. When the price drops to a comparable to smartphone + tablet then it will be more compelling. So I wonder, how long will it take for a new foldable to cost $800 or less?</p>

			 <p>It is <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/12/122333.html">practically impossible to trust any of the cable TV news outlets</a> because they are all owned by corporations who we know to be driven by profit motive. Even if one likes to watch Fox News or CNN and what you see is everything that you like to see, you should be smart enough to realize the only reason why you see it is for Fox or CNN to make money. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it is true and it certain is not fair and balanced or simply &ldquo;calling balls and strikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So yes,  you can blame the networks for what they are doing, but really, the problem is with the voters who appear to rather be entertained more than participate in democracy.</p>

<p>If members of Congress, no matter party, are unwilling to actually impeach those who support their ideology to maintain freedom for all citizens and not just a select few, you have in place opportunity for corruption and defacto dictatorship.</p>

Such skepticism taken to the extreme leads to a person fearful of everything and everyone, and that leads to them to shooting a kid who unexpectedly rings their doorbell.</p>

			 <p>We frequently fall in to the trap of thinking that how things work today is how they have always worked. Take for example voting in the United States. The whole concept of an &ldquo;independent voter&rdquo; is driven by the fact that today one can vote for people of different parties rather than all representatives from a single party. For example, you might vote for a Democrat for President and a Republican as your Senator.</p>
<p>What I learned while reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781635574630">The Age of Acrimony</a> is that in the 19th century there was only straight party ballots. The ballots may have been nothing more than a card of one of two different colors. Voting was not in private, one put their colored ballot in the ballot box while everyone else was watching. Elections could and often did become violent affairs. The invention of the ballot booth, with it&rsquo;s privacy curtain and the ability vote for people running for different offices rather than a party&rsquo;s representatives cooled the temperature of politics. It also created the idea of the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; voter.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the temperature of politics has definitely risen to higher temperatures over the years, highlighted by the insurrection on January 6, 2021. My theory is that the idea of voting for one&rsquo;s party, no matter who is running, has become more in vogue ever since Ronald Reagan, when I think the Republican party learned during Reagan&rsquo;s second term that what letter was next to the name of the candidate was more important than the actual person. The thinking is that what is most important is the party elected to office and not the person because the party&rsquo;s ideology is what is most important for leading toward the desired outcome. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the President has dementia if the decisions are really made by his handlers.</p>
<p>I think we will see this played out most vividly during the 2024 election. Neither Biden nor Trump are popular among Democrats or Republicans, but they will vote for either the Democrat or Republican candidate. The question will be how the so-called &ldquo;independents&rdquo; will vote, and that becomes more difficult when the campaigns become nothing more than don&rsquo;t vote for the other crazy old person.</p>
<p>Politics is broken because the system is gamed towards the status quo for the benefit of those people who gain from the status quo. Today this is not only the military industrial complex, but nearly every corporation in the United States. How else can you explain why all the candidate we can seem to elect are always of the same generation? Both parties rig it so that the anointed ones are the only options, hence incumbents never are challenged from within, and the non-incumbent pool of candidates are tightly controlled.</p>

It says that the best NFL wide receivers have less eye dominance, they tend to see equally well through both eyes. Apparently Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson is unique in that he alters eye dominance depending on his location on the field.</p>
<p>I think there is a similar relationship between vision and hockey players. As I watch Michigan Tech play I often am shocked when a player makes a bad pass that leads to a turnover and a score against. It seems evident that there is a less field of vision.</p>

			 <p>The most dangerous affect of bans on books and teaching by government is its erosion on the culture of free speech. While the United States has the first amendment that prohibits government censorship of nearly all speech, a culture of &ldquo;this is how we do it here&rdquo; is more important. One way that culture is expressed is when one says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with what you are saying, but I will fight for your right to say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/an-illustrated-guide-to-self-censorship">This article</a> does a great job of explaining why free speech, and thus the freedom of expression of ideas, is so important to liberty and progress. One thing the article does not address is the consequences of time. The time it took for the national mind to change its views on smoking and gay rights was long, and in today&rsquo;s Internet time, most will now say too long.</p>
<p>What happens in a society when more citizens lived after the Internet and the compression of time that it creates? I think you see this being played out right now with the issue of trans rights, many will not tolerate change taking as long as gay rights did because the have always lived in a world of instant gratification thanks to the Internet.</p>
<p>I think the current tug of war between nearly all dualism is become so intense due to the Internet&rsquo;s affect on the expectations of change. Half of society demands fast change, the other half prefers slower change and sees the only way to achieve it is by digging in their heels so they can be comfortable. The extremes demand an all or nothing approach, either all change right now, or no change now or maybe never. Both sides are so obsessed with the outcome they cannot see the consequences of the fight.</p>

			 <p>Ironically, I read about the last print publication of Maximum PC and MacLife via RSS and the web, which long ago for me replaced computer magazines. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2023/04/the-end-of-the-computer-magazine/">Harry McCracken writes</a> something like an obituary for the computer magazine.</p>
<p>Last week my wife told me the amazing news of a <a href="https://www.schulerbooks.com/about-west-bloomfield">new brick and mortar book store opening</a> within a mile of our house. The news brought back memories of spending hours in Borders and Barnes and Noble, both which were within a mile of our house and long since gone. (Sadly the Barnes and Noble building still sits empty more than a decade after it closed.) One of the main things I did in these stores was thumb through, and often buy, computer magazines, sometimes I would just read them while sitting in their cafe.</p>
<p>At one time I payed for subscriptions to several magazines, but over time as the web grew, there was little point in buying them. The web, and more specifically my blogs, even enabled me to live out the fantasy of being a writer like Jerry Pournelle.</p>
<p>And, so the excitement of the news about the new book store near me faded fast. Why would I shop there? Today I only buy ebooks and I get my computing news and do product research online. I know for many the medium is the message, and I truly hope there are enough such people living near me to keep the new book store open. Yes, I spent many hours browsing book stores and reading magazines but I&rsquo;ve never once missed the glossy print magazines nor the heft of Computer Shopper.</p>

			 <p>Easter has become so individualized that it has lost it&rsquo;s transformative message for the world. What really happened on Friday?

On Sunday we see that the powers and their violence do not have the last word. The reason why the powers still have hold today is that we continue to believe in them.</p>

While Thomas' continued participation in extravagant trips that he does not pay to attend is not illegal, it creates the appears of quid pro quo. Ethics isn&rsquo;t about laws, it&rsquo;s about appearance and trust. Americans are right to not trust the Supreme Court when justices don&rsquo;t care about ethics, and given that the Supreme Court is the most authoritarian branch of the U.S. government, the lack of ethics is frightening.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062434203">Resurrecting Easter</a> by John Dominic Crossan 📚</p>
<p>Today marks the beginning of Holy Week for Christians, and every year it seems the focus is on believing the stories happened rather than pondering upon and growing from the question, how are these stories relevant today?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Crucifixion story, what we have is a parable against civilization. The kingdom of Rome is a typical kingdom within the normal protocols of this world and, as such, it is based on violent force and imperial coercion. It is simply the normalcy of civilization in Mediterranean place and first-century time. But the kingdom of God is an antitypical kingdom in that it does not even allow violent “fighting” to free Jesus from execution—recall John 18:26. So the Crucifixion and Resurrection story is not simply about Jesus clashing with or triumphing over Pilate, but about a hopeful option for humanity to find a way out of the violence-based civilization it has created for itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true question of faith is not whether resurrection happened or has begun, but rather whether the world is being and will be transformed through our collaboration with Yahweh in Christ! Our lack of faith in the story of Jesus and in the work of Christ has us stuck in the normalcy of civilization.</p>

			 <p>I think we are getting near to testing the question of whether or not a U.S. President, former U.S. President, or a candidate for U.S. President is above the law. I don&rsquo;t think this question has ever really been answered/tested. Ford pardoned Nixon, so there never was an attempt at putting him on trial.</p>
<p>At the root of the question is whether our laws should be used for political gain. I think nobody would argue that laws should not be used for political gain, but doubt they never have been. On the other hand, the idea that anyone running for U.S. President is shielded from being put on trial does not seem right either as that means when one feels they are at risk they will simply declare their candidacy. I strongly suspect this is the reason why Trump declared he is running for President.</p>
<p>All of this reinforces how broken is the United States.</p>

The Frozen Four will be on April 6, Minnesota plays Boston University at 5 PM, Quinnipiac plays Michigan at 8:30 PM, the winners play each other for the national championship at 8 PM on April 8.

			 <p>I watched <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the final of the World Baseball Classic<!-- raw HTML omitted --> last night, and the semi-finals the days before. All the games we really exciting and bring good energy to the start of the baseball season. I know this will never happen due to obvious reasons, but I wonder whether the games would be better if they were played later in the season or at the end when presumably all the players are at the top of their game. Japan&rsquo;s pitching really dominated. Happy that Kyle Schwarber had that big hit in the eighth inning to give us a chance, but up to that point it looked like the USA was completely out of the game.</p>

			 <p>Just this past Wednesday I found myself in a conversation about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what is woke<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and what is anti-woke, as the person who I was talking to didn&rsquo;t understand. I think anti-woke as it is being used is easier to define. Basically, whenever someone is claiming they are anti-woke they mean they oppose the enforcement of beliefs upon themselves or others. For some it&rsquo;s simply the label for ideas they don&rsquo;t agree with or norms/rules they don&rsquo;t want to abide by. I think at the root of this issue is a decrease in tolerance for each other. As an example, one side may say one must use proper pronouns in reference to a person, the other side says that one must not be forced to use certain words or have to listen to one other&rsquo;s beliefs because listening is the same as indoctrination.  There is no effort made to meet in the middle because each side wants their way, one side says they are just being polite, the other side says they are just using common sense.</p>

The character limit does not apply to blog posts, the character limit applies to what appears in the micro.blog timeline. As has always been, posts that are longer than X character are linked to the associated blog post that contains all of the content. From my perspective, how micro.blog handles long posts in it&rsquo;s timeline is the same as how Feedland handles long posts in the feeds list.</p>
<p>Manton could change how the timeline works to expand/collapse long posts like Dave does in the Feedland  &ldquo;news&rdquo; display, but that is his prerogative as the hosting/platform provider. As a writer, I am willing to work within the constraints that he is providing. I don&rsquo;t see the constraint as limiting me as a writer in any way because the full content is provided on my blog, which frankly is where I prefer people to actual go and read what I write.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9136909?hl=en">Google Nest Hub</a> is frustrating to use because I want to use it as an Android display, as I think I should, but instead it only provides a very narrow set of functions. The most obvious use for me is displaying a local weather radar, which is useful during weather events. A simple way Google could provide this is by enabling Radarscope to run on it.</p>
<p>Today there is an ice storm moving through my area. An option I found is a Michigan weather live stream on YouTube, which I figured I could view on the Nest Hub because it has a YouTube app. Problem is, the YouTube app on the Nest Hub only displays a list of Recommended videos and does not provide me away to select a specific video on YouTube that I can watch. How come Google didn&rsquo;t provide the FULL YouTube app on the Nest Hub.</p>
<p>I can cast the video from my Pixel 4a to the Nest Hub, but it does not make sense to me that I should have to. I couldn&rsquo;t even get Google Assistant to display the video I want. some reason why I asked it to display a video from YouTube it wants to cast it to my TV rather than on the display itself!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In 2015 <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers proposed the idea</a> of sharing one&rsquo;s status by creating a /now page off of one&rsquo;s web site. The intent of the page is simply sharing what one is doing. <a href="https://nownownow.com/">The idea caught on</a> and today many sites, some more current than others, have a now page.</p>
<p>I decided to create and maintain my /now page using Dave Winer&rsquo;s Little Outliner because I felt it was a good editor for this type of writing, and it worked particularly well with another piece of software by Dave called pagePark. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark">PagePark</a> is a HTTP server that renders the OPML files that Little Outliner creates into HTML. Dave hosts an instance of pagePark that is integrated with Little Outliner such that as soon as an outline is saved, <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml">the HTML version of that outline</a> is nearly instantly available. Consequently, the process of editing and publishing changes to my /now page was as simple and quick as loading Little Outliner and writing. Low friction increases the possibility of keeping the page current.</p>
<p>Connecting my /now page to my blog was straightforward because the hosting provider makes it easy to create pages that redirect to other pages. Therefore, when you type <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/now">https://frankmcpherson.blog/now</a> you end up at my /now page. I took the idea of the page redirect off my blog a step further by purchasing a domain, frankm.info, that I configured to forward to the site. If anyone asked me online, what am I doing, I can tell them to simply go to <a href="http://frankm.info">frankm.info</a> to find out.</p>
<p>Over time I expanded beyond the single /now page to add pages that listed <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">the technology that I use</a> and the <a href="http://2022books.frankm.info">books that I have read</a>, each with their own alias URL. Using a forwarding URL enables me to move the actual location of the files, update the forwarding destination in DNS, and instances of the alias URL that I have in my writing will point to the current location.</p>
<p>Since the time that I set all this up using Little Outliner, Dave created a new &ldquo;version&rdquo; of it called <a href="https://drummer.land">Drummer</a>. I&rsquo;ve used Drummer since its beginning and always knew that it would some day replace Little Outliner. I didn&rsquo;t move my informational outlines to Drummer until recently when Twitter made changes to its API that Dave has been using for user identity management and login. Dave announced he would be updating Drummer with a new login process and also move access of it to HTTPS. He stated he did not intend to make changes to Little Outliner, and advised anyone using it to move to Drummer as soon as possible, and at that time I migrated my files over so that I can edit them in Drummer, and I updated the alias URLs accordingly.</p>
<p>Dave had to make the changes quickly because Twitter had not stated a clear deadline by which it would cut off access to its API, and that means prioritizing what he works on first. For example, the blogging capability Drummer provides currently does not work. I am sure that capability will be restored, and Dave will get to it when he gets to it. The &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; of OPML files via an instance of pagePark is also lower on the list. Consequently, I started thinking about what I can do to restore my ability to publish updates to my /now page.</p>
<p>One option was to stop using Drummer to edit these pages, but that would create a lot of work moving the content and formattting it. The option that I took was to build my own instance of pagePark. First I tried using <a href="https://pagepark.onrender.com">an instance of pagePark</a> that I built under a free account at <a href="https://render.com">Render</a>. Render only allows HTTPS access and the free account takes the site offline after 30 minutes. When you request the site, it&rsquo;s brought online but there is a noticable delay. Consequently, I built a new virtual machine using free resources provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve updated <a href="http://projects.frankm.info">my projects outline</a> with the details about how I set this up, it was pretty straightforward after I figured out how to get around firewall issues. What I have is not integrated with Drummer, so there is now a publishing step that involves downloading the files to my computer and syncing them to my instance of pagePark. I can edit at any time with any computer, but publishing is restricted to few computers I&rsquo;ve set up.</p>
<p>Right now access to these pages is only via HTTP. I&rsquo;ve looked at the page source for Drummer to see how Dave has changed the includes and I think I should be able to edit the templates pagePark uses with the right form of those includes to eliminate the mixed content errors. I intend to use the instance of pagePark I have on Render to test that work when I have time. If I get access to these files working on Render I will then have to decided how to handle the SSL certificates if I move off Render, which I would probably do by using Caddy.</p>

			 <p>If one is a child, a teenager, a college student in the United States, aware of the realities of the society that they currently live in, how can you possibily conclude anything other than the fact that the generations older, now Millenials through Baby Boomers, don&rsquo;t care about them at all? It&rsquo;s seems we have all forgotten the desire for providing our children a better life than our own. Better should be safer. Instead we do absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>I am Gen-X, and to my recollection the last time enough people in power were shocked enough by a shooting was in 1993 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act">the Brady Bill</a> was passed. Looking back from today, it seems that only the attempted murder of an old white man who happens to be President lead to action. Not murders of elementary, high school, and college students.</p>
<p>I see people of my generation ripping on younger generations as &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; and &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t seem to really care why. Might it be that in the United States the probability of a kindergartener experiencing an in-school shooting before graduating high school is greater than zero? I don&rsquo;t know this is a fact, but I know it&rsquo;s true, but the fact is that truth does not piss off enough people to take action.</p>
<p>Parents and grandparents need to stop convincing themselves their child will never face a shooting. It&rsquo;s time to stop numbing ourselves hoping that it will never happen. <strong>It&rsquo;s time to face the reality that it will happen, to your child, someone you love, maybe tomorrow.</strong></p>

<p>“I have heard that the ultimate expression of worship is obedience to a God-given command, submission, and giving. I have also heard that the ultimate expression to God is serving. But personal evolution leads me to believe that the ultimate expression of worship to God is being—being whom He created me to be. It is doing what He created me to do, being my purpose, and therefore doing my purpose. If I were asked, today, “What is worship to you?” Worship is doing what I’ve been created to do, what I am purposed to do and that is, to just be.”</p>

			 <p>Truth is, iPads and Macs are tools, and the choice between which one is used is not life and death. It&rsquo;s ok to choose a Mac over an iPad, and vice versa, and there is no real reason to try and convince someone that their choices are wrong. Apple does not expect either device to be the best for every single use case, otherwise they would only sell one device.</p>

			 <p>As the iPad has never been intended to function exactly like notebook and desktop computers, I doubt Apple will ever make them work exactly the same. You are never going to see MacOS running on iPads even if it could. Power users have been pushing Apple to make the iPad function more like Macs, and honestly iPadOS has moved a long way toward that direction. Much more than I would have ever expected. But the reality is, the iPad is never going to be a MacOS tablet and so one needs to come to terms with that reality. (Do you really want a Windows Tablet?)</p>

<p>“I believe it is impossible to overstate the defining nature of the empire of force among us, if empire is understood as a political, economic, military, ideological practice of self-security and control. It is not clear that life can be construed beyond empire; but the poets have to try. The poets, because they are poets, never arrive there, for their poetry would then become program. That, however, does not render the poetry as a failure or as an irrelevance. It only affirms that alternatives to the lethal reductionism of empire require imagination and courage and staying power. In that ancient world, it was required that old Jerusalem be relinquished and new Jerusalem be undertaken. It is no less required now that there be relinquishing and undertaking.”</p>

			 <p>“It is all good news . . . but you have to go! Israel has always been departing empire. That is how it began back in Egypt and that is how Nebuchadnezzar became the dominant metaphor for imperial power vis-à-vis the peculiar destiny of Israel. That has been the summons of Jesus to his people since his first “follow me.” He summoned away from all old regimes into the new regime that he inaugurated. To make a large, imaginative move, I suggest that it is the task of followers of this gospel in our society—who live in the totalitarian regime of military consumerism with all of its hopes and violences and anxieties—to depart.”</p>

			 <p>Dave is <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/26/145052.html">pointing out the relationship</a> between the United States paying its bills, the value of the U.S. dollar as the the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, and how that all translates to life as we know it in the United States. What Dave does not point out is that the the U.S. dollar being the world&rsquo;s reserve currency is a fundamental part of the United States Empire. It&rsquo;s how we can punish other nations like Russia and Iran with &ldquo;economic&rdquo; sanctions or why cutting Russia off from SWIFT (which is the network that all banks, including national banks use to move money around) is in fact punishing.</p>
<p>While (like the Roman empire) we have built U.S. Armed forces bases all around the world, U.S. citizens, let alone the world, will not accept frequent military intervention, so the bases are mostly for show of power and rapid deployment capability. Consequently, the economic tools, like the reserve currency, are the tools of choice that we use to flex U.S. might.</p>
<p>I think most nations know exactly how the U.S. uses the reserve currency status to imposes its will upon them and that is why some of them are considering using something other than the dollar. The U.S. missing payment on its bills will provide good reason for the nations to pull the trigger and that could start the fall of the U.S. empire. If this happens we will find out quickly just how much our way of life has grown to depend on empire.</p>
<p>P.S. The United States is the only country in the world to have dropped nuclear weapons on another country. The fact that we were willing then to do such a thing and the fact that we use our economic muscle to enforce our empire makes us the bad guys for most of the world. The good life we enjoy keeps us from seeing our shadow self.</p>

			 <p>Much that is wrong in the United States can be traced back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>, because he created and taught the doctrine in place in corporate America that everything, absolutely everything, is about making the wealthy class wealthier. Corporations exist to make wealth, and labor is simply the disposable batteries needed to fuel their wealth.</p>
<p>And, of course, the wealthy class fears the labor class, which is why they own those bunkers and houses on islands as far away from civilization as possible. For some, Mars or the moon may not be far enough. (And definitely do not allow labor to organize against us!)</p>
<p>The United States was founded upon and institutionalized class structure. White men ruled and controled Europe in the seventeenth century, how could anyone think that was not how America was structured? Madison, Jefferson, Washington, and Hamilton knew no different, it was and has been the &ldquo;norm of society.&rdquo; (By the way, this structure goes back well before the time of Jesus and he was killed by the state and the religious ruling class for preaching an alternative to the structure. Consequently, the U.S. might be called a christian nation by the defintion of institutionalzied christianity, but would not be called so by Jesus.)</p>
<p>Ours in the United States has been a more than 200 year struggle over the question of liberty for whom? Explicity at the founding liberty was only for white male property owners. Over the years laws and Constitutional ammendments have been passed to try and expand liberty to more people, but really, the class structure remains. The people at the top benefit so much from the way things are there is no real incentive to change. How else can the right hand of the U.S. institution, the Supreme Court, think that structural racism is no longer an issue, thus voting rights are not longer needed, or that anti-abortion laws are not a infringment on the liberty of nearly half the country, or that corporations (which is THE insitution of the wealthy class) have the same rights as citizens and should thus be allowed so spend as much money to buy politicians as they wish?</p>
<p><a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/google-should-fire-sundar-pichai">Mass layoffs</a> are the dopamine of the wealthy class. No CEO is ever going to be fired for announcing such a layoff because it is exactly what the wealthy class demands. Any CEO and board of a U.S. corporation knows that the quickest way to boost their stock price is by announcing a round of layoffs or buy announcing stock buy backs. Few CEOs know how to build anything, they only know the financial engineering they were taught in business school and what they see done all around them.</p>
<p>P.S. If you are invested in a 401k, you are being told that your interests align with the wealthy class. Assimilation is a very powerful tool of those in power.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve finished reading a fantastic three part series about the history of ARM written by Jeremy Reimer for Ars Technica. Here is a quote from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/a-history-of-arm-part-3-coming-full-circle/">the end of the series</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the key to Saxby’s management approach was simple yet uncommon in the business world: ARM grew because it helped others grow. It treated its employees more like people and less like human resources, giving them chances to learn and succeed along with the company. “I’m a great believer that in any team,” he told me, “any member is better at something than somebody else, so to get the team to perform you want everyone to perform on their best axis. Teams that work well together work better.” He emphasized the importance of being honest with employees and not overpromising what the company had to offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above resonates with me because the company I hired in to out of college, Electronic Data Systems, had the same business model, treat employees in a similar manner, and had success. Unlike ARM, EDS went through several different owners (GM, HP, HPE, CSC/DXC) and CEOs and each change moved further from the founding vision to the point at which it no-longer really exists.</p>
<p>The story also calls to mind <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780735213524">The Infinite Game</a> by Steve Sinek. Using Reimer&rsquo;s comparison of ARM and Commodore, ARM was playing the infinite game, Commodore the finite game. In the book Sinek describes the reletively few businesses playing the &ldquo;infinite game&rdquo; versus the vast majority playing the &ldquo;finite&rdquo; game. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Infinite games have infinite time horizons. And because there is no finish line, no practical end to the game, there is no such thing as “winning” an infinite game. In an infinite game, the primary objective is to keep playing, to perpetuate the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having been hired by EDS and surviving through the multitude of transitions that has occurred, I have seen first hand the differences a building a company, which usually has a founder, and buying a company, which usually has a manager. In most cases bought companies are separated from their founding, has no leadership and thus no culture.</p>
<p>It amazes me that given all the evidence of how to achieve long term success, such as ARM&rsquo;s, that so few U.S. companies are interested in the infinite game. The finite game rules business, thus it rules capitalism, and given relationship of capitalism to the United States, the finite game rules the U.S. I don&rsquo;t think prospects will change in the United States until we find leaders who are builders, right now our political, economic, and religions cultures appear to all be playing the finite game.</p>

			 <p>Nobody should be surprised that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/12/exxon-climate-research-predicted-global-warming">big oil has long known the impact of carbon on the the climate</a>, just as big tobacco long knew about the relationship of nicotine on cancer. Likewise, I am certain Facebook, Twitter, and Google all know the impact of social networks on mental health.</p>
<p>In my opinion the root cause to this behavior is the acceptance in the United States that it&rsquo;s ok for one to profit from the misery of another. Any means toward the ends of more and more profits to the oligarchs is accepted by everyone, even for whom are the most affected.</p>
<p>If you truly read the history of the United States you will learn that from the discovery of the content through to present time the United States has existed to make one class of people rich at the expense of anyone and anything that would be in the way of that class becoming more rich. This fact has made the United States, and many other countries in the Western Hempisphere very different from other countries in the world.</p>
<p>The history of the United States is very much a fight, back and forth, between the oligarchs and everyone else. Everyone else won over the oligarchs in the U.S. Civil War, but the oligarchs clawed their way back up until FDR and the New Deal. Ever since the end of WW II the oligarchs have been fighting back and gained great ground during the Reagan years, and their accendancy has continued ever since no matter which poliitcal party has been in power.</p>
<p>Today it appears that everything is in place for the oligarchs to completely assume control over nearly everything in the United States. Trump pretty much sealed the deal by placing the oligarch&rsquo;s choice of justices to the Supreme Court, under the disguise of overturning Roe v. Wade. More consequential rulings are coming to remove the New Deal, Civil Rights, and election laws that were put in place as guardrails against the oligarchs.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Civl War everyone else rose up against the oligarchs by forming a new political party (Republicans), and electing Abraham Lincoln, which lead to the Civl War and the oligarch&rsquo;s defeat. Unfortunately, the oligarchs appear to have closed that risk to them by changing election laws and the amont of money it takes to be elected President to insure no party that they don&rsquo;t control can possibly be a threat. At the moment it seems to me the only real possible equally dramatic act would be for enough states to open a Constitutional Convention that would fundamentally re-form the United States for good or ill.</p>

			 <p>Ken Smith writes about what he calls <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2023/01/12/190337.html?title=essentialFluency">Essential Fluency</a> that I think relates to <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/01/11/seth-godin-says.html">my reaction to Seth Godin&rsquo;s call for the end of high school essays</a>. Also related to these topics is another article that was sent via email, the gist of it calling for universities to be replaced by corporate-sponsored trade schools.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much of a stretch to say that education in the United States is a mess. At the root of the problem is a belief that in order for one to obtain a good paying job in the United States one must have a college degree. I think this approach is a contributor to the huge wealth gap in the United States because not everyone has the aptitude, not to mention the financial resources, to get a college degree.</p>
<p>I think part of the answer to the problem is a increased emphasis on experience and skills, which I relate to Ken Smith&rsquo;s post about fluency, and a decreased empahsis on degrees and certifications. Most corporate funded education looks more like certifications.</p>
<p>Using experience as a scale, you could put people in two categories of jobs: entry level and non-entry level. A person hired in to an entry level position would be expected to have the rudimentary skills (reading, writing, math) but the company hiring them would provide the full suite of training need ot fill the roles of the  company. No-entry level would be direct hire in to the roles. In neither of these cases is a college degree needed.</p>

			 <p>Seth Godin says <a href="https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-end-of-the-high-school-essay/">good riddance to high school essays</a>. Apparently he doesn&rsquo;t see the value in learning how to write, in how to construct a clear and compelling message that one reads. Apparently the fact that still more than the majority of what is on the Internet is in written form doesn&rsquo;t matter. Ask any college professor about the quality of writing seen from students. Although, given that it&rsquo;s so bad today, perhaps just not even bothering to teach kids how to write is the way. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like we really care about education in the United States because that would lead to more equality, and equality impedes the liberty of those at the top of the pyramid.</p>

			 <p>It seems to happen every time there is a migration of people from one application to another. When the new people start using the new application they seem to expect that the features and functions of the previous application to exist in the new one. When they can&rsquo;t find the function, they ask where it is, and if they are told that it doesn&rsquo;t exist it seems they then start to complain or at least doubt the reasons for why the function doesn&rsquo;t exist with the alternate application.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the idea that every application should work exactly the same is problematic. Micro.blog was created specifically to not be Twitter and Mastodon was created specifically to not be Twitter, and the value of these applications are that they are not Twitter!</p>
<p>And you know what, it&rsquo;s ok! Life can exist without a &ldquo;like&rdquo; button and it can exist without a quote &ldquo;tweet.&rdquo;  We don&rsquo;t need to change the minds of those who disagree, we just need to figure out how to co-exist.</p>

<p>“After Steffens laid out the corruption of seven cities, his conclusion pointed straight at readers in their easy chairs. The simple truth, Steffens wrote, was that politicians were expert readers of public demands, and the public had not demanded good government. <strong>Instead, for decades they had been driven by outrage, alternately between political parties, throwing out one set of bums, then the other.</strong> Steffens asked: “Do we Americans really want good government? Do we know it when we see it? Are we capable of that sustained good citizenship which alone can make democracy a success?””</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the largest deal that Jed Hoyer’s front office has inked during his time in charge, and it’s just really not that big of a contract relative to the rest of the league or the Cubs monetary might. It doesn’t crack the top ten in MLB in years or AAV. It is the second largest deal in the history of the Cubs franchise, and it is nowhere near the top 20 contracts as of 2021, let alone ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I see in Hoyer is a baseball executive afraid to make a mistake. Under the rubric of sustaining success one may never have the chance to win championships. What we appear to have here is a plan of waiting to see how the season goes, and if half way through they have a real chance, then make trades to sign players you need, which is what happened in 2016.</p>
<p>The question then is whether the Cubs have enough talent going in to the season to have a good first half and be buyers at the trade deadline. With the players they have signed and the young talent they have, the 2023 Chicago Cubs on paper are better than the 2022 Chicago Cubs, the problem though is that the Cardinals have also gotten better, and they added Wilson Contreras to a team with the reigning MVP.</p>

			 <p>No matter how frustrated and angry I am with the Chicago Cubs front office for not signing any free agents of consequence, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The only real thing that matters is how Ricketts (the owner) feels about the result. If I am the owner of a team and I give the people running the team the greenlight to spend money to improve the team and they don&rsquo;t do it, I am not happy with their results and I will come to the conclusion that changes are needed.</p>
<p>Hoyer has been a big part of the decision making since after the Cubs won the World Series. Since 2017 the Cubs have regressed in their effort to return to the World Series. Looking for changes from the same people making decisions is insane, you need to change the decision makers to get a different result.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the Chicago Cub&rsquo;s division competitors have become much better this off season than the Cubs, and so they are losing the offseason. It might be that the Cubs surprise with their own talent, but I think that Ricketts has to start losing patience with Hoyer. If the Cubs are at the bottom of the division and out of the running by June, I think Hoyer must go. If Hoyer continues to stay then I can only conclude that he is performing to the level Ricketts expects and therefore all the talent decisions are on him.</p>

			 <p>I am testing sending what I write in my blogs to Day One via an <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> applet that is monitoring their RSS feeds. There are two problems. First, the IFTTT applet doesn&rsquo;t do a good job of handling titleless posts, second, hyperlinks in the posts are stripped, seemingly even if I create the links using markdown.</p>
<p>The applet simply creates new entries to Day One in an order and it appears that if the title is blank then the next entry in the item content is used for the title, which by default that is the item link. I moved the item link to below the item content, but my temporary work around is to configure the applet to create a &ldquo;default&rdquo; title for every post, with the actual title, it it exists, on the following line. but this is not optimal.</p>
<p>It looks like I could add some Javascript logic to the applet so I am wondering if I could simply write some code to inspect the feed title and skip it, but that may take some time to figure it out. I wonder whether anyone else has already done this?</p>

Good news is that the weekly reported cases is flat compared to this time last year. Bad news is that the infection rate, which is a leading indicator to the community numbers, is trending upward having been relatively level (up and down around 1) since August. It doesn&rsquo;t look like we will reach the levels of new cases through the end of December and January like we did last year, but we clearly are getting the somewhat expected increases with the holidays and colder weather upon us.</p>

I think it was widely expected that the 2022 midterm elections would be highly influenced by inflation and the state of the economy that we are now experiencing, but yet it was abortion and election denial that influenced the election even more. I wonder though, is the fact that these topics were the main influencers good? Or was the result of the election that those who are profiting significantly from our current state given a free pass?</p>

			 <p>It seems that at least once a year something happens with Evernote, the company, that results in a number of people deciding to ditch Evernote, the app. I am a long time, paying customer of Evernote and for the moment I don&rsquo;t intend to change unless I need to. However, Evernote for me is more of a repository than a notetaking application. I particularly like it&rsquo;s web clipping, but I also forward particular emails such as emailed receipts.</p>
<p>A while back I decided it was worth trying export some or all of my Evernote notebooks and import them to another app, just in case something were to happen. I found that the best import was to DEVONthink and the second best was OneNote. I tested with an eval copy of DEVONthink but decided to not buy it as what I got in to OneNote was good enough.</p>

			 <p>I play in two fantasy football leagues, one that uses the ESPN app and the other that uses Yahoo. I find it interesting how opinionated both apps are in terms of how they are used on tablets and phones. On iPads the apps only work in landscape orientation no matter which way one is holding the iPad, which I find frustrating because they are literally the only apps on my iPad that does this. On my smartphones the apps only work in portrait, again no matter how you actually hold the phone.</p>
<p>The smartphone behavior is even more interesting on the Microsoft Surface Duo. I have the two apps in a group so they both launched, one on each screen, and they look fine when I am holding the Duo in &ldquo;book&rdquo; or landscape orientation, but when I rotate the Duo into portrait orientation the apps rotate to maintain portrait while the individual screens are landscape.</p>
<p>Regardless of the platform, I find it very hostile to me as a user that the app only works in one way as this is completely unlike any other app. It&rsquo;s as if the developers don&rsquo;t actually use the platforms for which they are developing.</p>

It makes good points, but in my opinion does not go deep enough. To truly grow, learn the difference between joy and happiness. Happiness is dependent on externalities, whereas joy is a state of being. Said differently, joy is a conscious choice, a practice if you, for how to see everything. Happiness will not help you love your opponent, but joy will.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We tend to think about RSS in terms of web sites and web applications and what gets over looked is how you can use it personally. For example, I send items from <a href="http://feedland.org">FeedLand</a> to <a href="http://radio3.io">Radio3</a> to add to my linkblog. I have an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> applet monitoring the linkblog RSS file that takes new items and adds them to <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, which retrieves and stores the full article content that I read later.</p>
<p>As I read articles in Pocket I might highlight parts that I want to remember. The highlights in Pocket are grabbed by <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a>, where I can read through them and have them presented to me daily. Finally, Readwise exports the article highlights to Roam and Evernote.</p>
<p>In this example RSS is the backbone to my personal knowledge collection and refinement.  It glues together for me hundreds of web sites and six applications.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://daytona.scripting.com">Daytona</a> is effectively a personal search engine that indexes the OPML files stored with my Drummer account. I am able to use it to search through a good chunk of my writing that I have published to the web over the last decade.</p>
<p>What I would like is to get what I add to <a href="http://radio3.io/users/frankm/rss.xml">my linkblog feed</a>, which is RSS/XML, in to Daytona. What I need is a way to copy new entries of an RSS file to an OPML file that could be stored in Drummer and indexed by Daytona. I don&rsquo;t need this to happen in real time, I could live with producing the file once a month. Note that you can see my linkblog feed in the <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/?tab=links">Links tab of my daynotes site</a>.</p>
<p>I imagine a nodejs script that takes as input a RSS xml file, reads each item and creates a new OPML node with the content and link to the article. The output would be a corresponding OPML file written in the same directory that I could import in to Drummer. The OPML structure could be based on the date. For example, the top level node is the month, and the child nodes would be date. Pretty much the Drummer blog structure. The RSS items on a date would be children of the date nodes.</p>
<p>If I had such a RSS to OPML script I would use it to make OPML versions of my Radio3 linkblog feed, my FeedLand Feed, and maybe even my micro.blog RSS file. The result would index all the content I publish to the web in Daytona that I could then search for when desired.</p>

It goes on to state how their DNS registrar effectively provides verification that they are who they are.</p>

<p>We’ve opted to host our own instance. We’ve done this because, with multiple instances out there, we had to decide how to make sure people following us knew that our Raspberry Pi account was the “real” one.</p>

			 <p>The only stream that I follow consistently and frequently is my RSS stream. While I cross post what I write on my blog to Twitter, I don’t check Twitter often, mostly just during events like the Super Bowl. I check my micro.blog stream a couple times a day, and I frankly appreciate its smaller size (relative to Twitter) that makes it easier to get to know people over time.</p>
<p>I created an account on Mastodon this week, but it overwhelms me in the same way as Twitter. Too much from too many people I don’t know. I feel like I am already at max news/social streams and don’t need more nor alternatives. Debating about whether I even want to find an app for Mastodon to put on my iPad.</p>

I like that swiping left or right from the watch face displays a tile because it lets me decide what I want to access most quickly. To be a tile is basically an app, and I find it hard to really differentiate between the two. My main complaint is that recents is not really recents, and seems to constantly change to whatever WearOS thinks I would want. For some reason Fitbit Exercise, which is my swipe left tile, and Fitbit today always end up at the top of recents.</p>

<p>A reason for the dismantling of pensions and the attacks on social security is to make us all capitalists through 401ks. The above is as much a description of Trump as it is of Musk. The oligarchs have been at war with the citizens of the United States since the 1930s.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s clear to me how <a href="http://feedland.org/?river">FeedLand</a> is a reboot of RSS because it makes <a href="http://feedland.org/?log">building and managing a list RSS feeds</a> real easy. Ever since he released Radio Userland I have been using Dave Winer&rsquo;s blog and RSS products, and I have been using River5 for many years. Radio Userland was unlike any other RSS product I have used because it fused reading (RSS) and writing (blogging) in one product, River5 and <a href="http://radio3.io">Radio3</a> is the split of those two functions, and I still use Radio3 for my linkblogging and adding items to read later to Pocket.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> is a Nodejs application that you can clone to your own server, which I have running in Google Cloud. The main difficulty with River5 is in maintaining one&rsquo;s RSS subscription list because it ultimately has to be accessed via a file that is stored locally on the server running River5. My solution has been to add an include node in the local subscription file, and store the file that is included in AWS where I can edit using Little Outliner via <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a>. FeedLand removes the hassle of figuring out where to put and how to edit my RSS subscriptions at the price of the app being hosted by Dave rather than on one of my own servers.</p>
<p>If your remember Google Reader and wish it still exists, I strongly encourge you to check out <a href="http://feedland.org">FeedLand</a> because in my opinion it does what Google Reader provided, but more!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the 1860s through the early 1900s, presidential elections drew the highest turnouts ever reached, were decided by the closest margins, and witnessed the most political violence. Racist terrorism during Reconstruction, political machines that often operated as organized crime syndicates, and the brutal suppression of labor movements made this the deadliest era in American political history. The nation experienced one impeachment, two presidential elections &ldquo;won&rdquo; by the loser of the popular vote, and three presidential assassinations. Control of Congress rocketed back and forth, but neither party seemed capable of tackling the systemic issues disrupting Americans' lives. Driving it all, a tribal partisanship captivated the public, folding racial, ethnic, and religious identities into two warring hosts.</p>

			 <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is the most authoritarian branch of U.S. government. Nearly every low moment of U.S. History is tied to Supreme Court decisions, some which later were overturned. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-conservative-stalwart-challenging-the-far-right-legal-theory-that-could-subvert-american-democracy?utm_source=pocket_mylist">A case will go in front of the Supreme Court in December</a> that could decide the fate of demoracy in the United States. It could give state legislatures power to decide any federal election, overturning the will of the people. Given the current make up of the court, I am not optimistic that demoracy will survive.</p>

			 <p>I think 538 has made a pretty <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/aaron-rodgers-deep-ball-struggles/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">good analysis of the Green Bay Packers' offense</a>, although I disagree with their inferrence that Rodgers can improve the offense on his own. Truth is, any quarterback, even former MVPs need an offensive line that blocks and wide receives who can get open and catch the ball. Rodgers has neither. Why was Rodgers MVP last year? Davante Adams. Right now the Green Bay Packers have no reliable pass receiver, period.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if the Packers were to make a trade mid season, and I doubt they would because they are still old school, they should trade Rodgers. There is no season hanging on to a quarterback of his calliber if you aren&rsquo;t going to surround him with play makers. Frankly, they have been doing to Aaron what they did to Brett, it&rsquo;s just that this time they didn&rsquo;t draft an Aaron Rodgers to replace him.</p>

			 <p>I find <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/17/have-mlbs-revamped-playoffs-made-the-baseball-season-an-unfair-mockery">the complaining</a> about the current results of this year&rsquo;s MLB playoffs ridiculous. While it&rsquo;s true that three teams that won more than 100 games this year have not made it to the league championships, those teams had the same chance to win their five game series than the teams they lost to.</p>
<p>No professional nor college sport simply have the regular season league champions play each other at the end of a season to decide which team is the best for that season. Yes, even baseball once had a four team championship series before the World Series. All sport playoffs simply decide who is the tournament champion, and the reason why tournaments are appealing is because they have upsets.</p>
<p>Regular sports seasons are played for a team&rsquo;s opportunity to participate in the tournament, and for the fan&rsquo;s enjoyment in watching their team compete for that right. Tournaments are for leagues and teams to make lots of money off the drama they create.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-daughter-was-right-regret-iphone-14-pro-max-2022-9?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Business Insider implies</a> that Apple did something wrong with the iPhone 14, the author regrets upgrading from the iPhone 13. What is really wrong is the author thinking of it as an upgrade to the iPhone 13 and then buying the phone, but there <strong>shouldn&rsquo;t</strong> be a reason why one buys a new phone every year. The iPhone 14 isn&rsquo;t to replace the iPhone 13, it&rsquo;s just this year&rsquo;s model that if one owns an iPhone and wants to replace it with the current model, then that is the one to buy.</p>
<p>In fact, probably the only real reason why the iPhone 14 is called the iPhone 14 is because that makes it easier to talk and write about. In practice, we should think of the iPhone like a car. The iPhone 14 is the 2023 model of the iPhone. Next year Apple will announce and start selling the 2024 model fo the iPhone.</p>
<p>Very few people replace their car every year because the model they bought works just fine, and that&rsquo;s a good thing otherwise there would be a lot more junkyards.</p>

			 <p>It might be shocking to some to realize that the question of whether the United States is a single country or a union of states is not decided. One would think that the question was answered at the end of the Civil War, except that the 10th amendment was not repealed. Nor was the electoral college, nor other parts of the constitution that treat states as sovereign. Consequently, we live with the reality that citizen&rsquo;s votes are not equal in Presidential elections. If you live in California, your vote matters less than if you live in Ohio. It&rsquo;s not right, but it&rsquo;s a consequence of where one chooses to live.</p>
<p>Those who benefit from the status quo <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3638807-when-not-if-should-the-electoral-college-be-eliminated/">see the Electoral College as a feature rather than a flaw</a>.</p>

			 <p>Part of the backlash against Biden&rsquo;s plan to forgive federal student loans is really a backlash against education. College education has become stereotyped into identities that some dislike. The fact that American society has pushed the necessity of a college degree for one to get a good job and have a good life is also problematic and wrong.</p>
<p>Scary thing is, true education in which one practices critical thinking and decision making is more critical now than ever. The United States is not and was not ever intended to be a pure democracy. Our government is a representative democracy, which by definition means there are gatekeepers, some voted in to positions (Congress, the President), some appointed by those we voted for (Supreme Court, Attorney General, Secretary of State), and some defacto (political parties, the Press).</p>
<p>Technology is eroding away the whole idea of gatekeepers upon whom our country was built, which slides us towards pure democracy. At first this might seem like a good thing, but what it really means is that more responsibility is with citizens. From within democracy tyranny can easily emerge, all it takes is to convince enough people that the tyrant&rsquo;s cause is virtuous.</p>
<p>The guardrails against tyranny is education and free speech, and liberty to practice both. Critical thinking and systemic decision making. If we are left to not trust politicians, journalists, or anybody else for that matter, then we need to be able to trust ourselves. Education does not necessarily mean a college degree, but it does mean an openness to idea that one might be wrong, the desire to understand why, and the willingness to change one&rsquo;s mind.</p>

			 <p>“Our religion can “hell-ify” us by inspiring in us an impenetrable sense of rightness or even <strong>superiority</strong>. That sense of rightness can inoculate us against humility, infusing in us an excessive confidence or addiction to certainty that keeps us from seeing our mistakes until after the harm has been done—to others (including our children) and to ourselves. Our religion is right, we believe, which makes us right. As a result, the more devoted we are, the more stubborn and unteachable we become. And everyone can see it but us, because we’re blinded by our sincerity and zeal.”</p>

<p>A big problem in American society, perhaps the problem, is too much religion. The reason why is because most people do not know what religion is, that it is more than agreeing to a set of beliefs or attending a church. Re-ligio means to re-bind, but &ldquo;re&rdquo; anything infers we do it already. What we bind ourselves to is how we see ourselves, it becomes our very identity, our idolatry. Everything we bind ourselves to is a layer of our false self, put in place from the outside.</p>

			 <p>The Kansas State Supreme Court, in their decision that the Kansas state constitution provided the right to abortion by borrowing from the language of the Declaration of Independence: &ldquo;All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/08/06/what-happened-in-kansas-americans-know-that-rights-are-not-just-suggestions/">They wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Included in that limited category is the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one&rsquo;s own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination. This right allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life—decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am glad to see someone other than me define liberty as including the ability to have control over one&rsquo;s own body. Unfortunately, SCOTUS does not agree with the Kansas State Supreme Court about that same language. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court is attacking liberty for all for the sake of a perceived infringement on religious liberty is very dangerous, although sadly no unprecedented, SCOTUS has been attacking liberty practically since its beginning.</p>

			 <p>Greed drives <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/08/05/nikkei-taiwan-propaganda">most of the capitalism in the United States</a> with little thought about the consequences. We are currently living through the consequences of a war a world away between Russia and Ukraine, imagine what happens if war breaks out in the Far East where everything we buy and use in the United States is manufactured. Have you tried to buy a car lately? Greed has put us in this bad place where China has a vice grip on our economy.</p>
<p>In the 1920s greed drove the United States and the world over a financial cliff toward a Depression. It took a World War and the New Deal laws to get the country back on its feet, but the wealthy minority, which has a lot of power because everything including votes and court decisions can be bought in the U.S., has been waging war against the majority, what we once knew as the middle class, ever since. Everything going on in the U.S. is a consequence if this war.</p>
<p>At the root of the issue is the claims on the definition of liberty. On one side, that includes the wealthy, is the claim liberty means one can do whatever one wants. On the other side is the claim that one&rsquo;s claim to their personal liberty ends when it infringes on the liberties of others. The extreme libertarian side pushes toward anarchy, the extreme other side pushes toward over regulation, and in the middle is supposed to be the idea of the rule of law.</p>

			 <p>Six years ago I felt positive things were happening for the Chicago Cubs. <a href="http://sports.frankmcpherson.net/2014/09/01/theBuzzOnTheNorthSide.html">I wrote then</a> about all the young talent that was getting a chance to play and looked forward to the future. Honestly, I feel a bit that way this year. The Cubs young guys who have been given a chance to play have demonstrated they are capable. I think next year they should be competitive in the NL Central.</p>

			 <p>Against my better judgement, I ordered the new Google Pixelbuds Pro from the Google Store and once again I have evidence that delivery of products from the Google Store is at best cursed if not flat out incompetent.</p>
<p>To my surprise I found that Google shipped the Pixelbuds via UPS, which I thought was good because UPS seems to know what they are doing, but then I saw the indicator that it is really via Mail Innovations. I think this is the service in which UPS and the USPS partner in delivery with UPS doing the cross country transport and USPS doing the last mile, and it means more moving parts to fail.</p>
<p>The Pixelbuds shipped out of Bensenville, IL on July 26 and arrived in a UPS sorting facility in Urbancrest, OH, which is a suburb of Columbus. According to the UPS tracker, the package then was delivered to USPS in West Bloomfield, MI, which is where I live, on July 29 but rather than being delivered to me on August 1 as originally expected the next update on that date was another &ldquo;sorted&rdquo; at UPS facility in Urbancrest, OH.</p>
<p>To date the package has yet to arrive. I know there is no guarantee date and that I did not pay extra for shipping, but I am wondering why it appears stuck in Ohio as if nobody knows what to do with it. I can&rsquo;t remember whether I even had the option to pay for delivery.</p>
<p>Worse, despite the fact that when I click the &ldquo;Track Package&rdquo; link in the notification of shipment email that Google sends goes to a ups.com site, when I manually enter the tracking number via my UPS.com account it indicates as not a UPS shipment. I go to usps.com and it indicates it &ldquo;departed shipping partner facility&rdquo; on July 28 in Grove City, OH, which is probably the same location indicated by UPS, but there is no other update on the USPS site.</p>
<p>None of these shippers provide me, a user, to click a link on these tracking pages to send to the shipper and ask them what is up with my shipment, even when I have an account set up with their site. I use Informed Delivery with USPS and normally as soon as a USPS shipping label is printed I get a text notification, but not this time. I can only conclude that &ldquo;Main Innovations&rdquo; is a very cheap and thus low quality shipping serivce. The bottom line to me is that Google Store compromises on customer service for the sake of cutting costs. It all adds up to a once again poor experience with Google Store.</p>
<p>Prior three orders of phones and the Pixelbook, which are more expensive items, where delivered to the wrong address. I get packages from Amazon and other online stores via UPS and Fedex with no problem, but every dang one from Google Store is messed up.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just got a text from USPS that the package arrived in West Bloomfield and will be delivered tomorrow.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.bleachernation.com/cubs/2022/08/02/the-cubs-do-not-trade-willson-contreras-or-ian-happ/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Shock in Wrigleyville</a> as the Cubs did NOT trade Wilson Contreras or Ian Happ as nearly everyone expected. During the lead up to the trade deadline pundits were bemoaning the fact the Cubs just trade away all the players who were so important to winning the 2016 World Series. Now pundits are bemoaning the fact the trades were not made!</p>
<p>The reason why trades were made is simple, teams didn&rsquo;t want to pay the price the Cubs were asking for. Contreras is the best catcher in baseball and you don&rsquo;t just give that caliber of player away for some prospects, except maybe a team of prospects. Before Soto became available Contreras was one of the best, if not the best, hitters available. When the Nationals announced they were open to trades, Contreras was no longer the best hitter, he was just the best catcher available. Teams buying simply decided they had needs greater than catcher.</p>
<p>My hope is that the Cubs make a serious attempt to signing Contreras to a new contract during the offseason. Wilson is a player worthy of being the cornerstone to the next great Cubs team, particularly given the additon of the designated hitter. You need leadership to win in any sport, and Wilson provides it to a team of young players and particularly a team with young pitchers. I think Wilson is worth the money he asks for.</p>

			 <p>Consider this. We don&rsquo;t have a Supreme Congress, we don&rsquo;t even have a Supreme President, despite what Trump thinks, but we do have a Supreme Court. By name and by implementation the Supreme Court is the most authoritarian and most dangerous branch of U.S. government. The people who make up this supreme branch of government are not elected but appointed for life! There are no qualifications for appointment, which means those who are appointed are put there because they ideologically agree with those who do the appointing. Nearly every one of the most wrong and most embarrassing moments of U.S. history can be traced back to a Supreme Court decision. And, the Constitution really does not define what it is that the court does nor its power, those were all decided by members of the court itself. No wonder why there are originalists, the origins of the Supreme Court allow them to reign with impunity.</p>
<p>Remember this despite the marketing of the current justices.</p>

			 <p>Much talk regarding the Chicago Cubs probable trades of some of their remaining &ldquo;core&rdquo; players, <a href="https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDFKgntgzECCprcUnAvCztsqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowlPVUMLXBDDD0ocAD?uo=CAUikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2N1YnMvY3QtY2hpY2Fnby1jdWJzLWt5bGUtc2Nod2FyYmVyLXdpbGxzb24tY29udHJlcmFzLWlhbi1oYXBwLTIwMjIwNzI0LTV0MjRyejd6ZHpjdG5sdjJhZWJ1NTVtemRhLXN0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen">Wilson Contreras and Ian Happ</a>, mostly due to the big sell off last year.</p>
<p>One big difference this year, I think, is that the Cubs may be trading away the best catcher in baseball. As good as Bryant, Rizzo, and Baez were you can&rsquo;t say they were the best at their positions. The last time the Cubs cast aside the best in his position was Gregg Maddux, and that trade might have contributed a decade or more of &ldquo;same old Cubs&rdquo; baseball.</p>
<p>It seems to be that Cubs ownership and front office don&rsquo;t understand that there is a difference between turning a franchise around, as they did before 2016 and maintaining the culture that as built during the turnaround. Continual selling and tanking was warranted to turn around a 108 year problem, but that is NOT how you maintain the culture, in fact it destroys what culture that has been built.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Cardinals provides the template of excellence, and the Cubs should know this well since the Cardinals have been their main rival since the beginning of baseball time. The Cardinals prioritize re-signing players, even at the price of overpaying, to maintain their culture.</p>
<p>So far, the current Cubs ownership and front office has not had one major re-signing of player on their roster, and that sends a clear message. The message is sends is that while they might now how to turn a team around, they don&rsquo;t know how to keep it at the top.</p>

<p>Which one is the True American?</p>
<p>My point is not that I agree with or support Pence, but besides Democracy, what is the real difference between he and Trump? Any election that involves Donald Trump is a referendum on the representative Democracy/Republic that is the United States.</p>
<p>If comes down to a question of Democracy or no Democracy, I pick Democracy every. single. time. What about you?</p>

			 <p>Here is a fact of how things work in the United States that people don&rsquo;t seem to like. The only real way change works is when both parties agree to make change. Further, our government is not set up so that the President can do anything he pleases, unlike what Trump might want everyone to think.</p>
<p>Consequently, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-are-disillusioned-over-climate-change/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">blaming Biden</a> for any legislation, like climate change, not passing is B.S. because Congress has to pass legislation first. Guess what, a 50/50 split in the Senate means that enough people from <strong>both</strong> parties have to agree.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this hurdle on change is by design, it&rsquo;s not a bug. It was built, however, on the premise that those elected would actually govern and would not simply vote along party lines even to vote against the best interests of their constituents.</p>

			 <p>Serendipity&hellip;.first I read,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you love people, you see all the good in them, all the Christ in them. God sees Christ, His Son, in us and loves us. And so we should see Christ in others, and nothing else, and love them. There can never be enough of it. There can never be enough thinking about it. St. John of the Cross said that where there was no love, put love and you would take out love. The principle certainly works.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Love and ever more love is the only solution to every problem that comes up. If we love each other enough, we will bear with each other’s faults and burdens. If we love enough, we are going to light that fire in the hearts of others. And it is love that will burn out the sins and hatreds that sadden us. It is love that will make us want to do great things for each other. No sacrifice and no suffering will then seem too much. &ndash; <a href="https://email.cac.org/t/ViewEmail/d/250A9DAE5360473D2540EF23F30FEDED/3F2D2805E5B983A925D77A725F39070E?alternativeLink=False_">Dorothy Day</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then I read&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically the lesson is this &ndash; we all suck. Judge us on what we&rsquo;ve done, our actions. Inside we all have ugly thoughts, the question is how much do you act on them. If you think I&rsquo;ve created something interesting, consider that perhaps I could do it again. If I&rsquo;ve been generous maybe I am generous. Maybe you have prejudices. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been dismissed as too old to do what I actually did. Like the time, at a conference, a young person asked if I knew what a podcast was, with a doubtful look on her face as if oh god I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m actually talking to someone this ignorant. &ndash; <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/21/163518.html?title=doYouFeelYoureBetterThanMe#a163835">Dave Winer</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After I read about how a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/walgreens-employee-refused-sell-condoms-couple-faith-rcna39165?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">Walgreens employee</a> refused to sell condoms and felt the need to embarass the people trying to buy them.</p>
<p>I continue to be shocked by how people who claim to be Christians make no effort to live out what Jesus taught and thus actually follow him. Richard Rohr says that a Christian is someone who sees Christ in everyone and everything. It is how we love God, by loving what God loves. We all sin, we all have imperfections, and never once did Jesus teach us to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/walgreens-employee-refused-sell-condoms-couple-faith-rcna39165?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">refuse to serve</a> or cast out someone who we think might be sinning. Jesus didn&rsquo;t teach to do whatever we want to prevent sin to happen, because frankly, that is not possible. Jesus taught us to do one thing, follow him, mirror him by loving God through loving what God loves, which is everything!</p>
<p>Honestly, we in the United States must stop using the claim of &ldquo;religious liberty&rdquo; in the name of not doing things one does not want to do. Freedom of religion does not make one superior over another, and the first amendment is more about preventing government (power) from using religion to take freedom away for citizens, as was common practice in the 17th and 18th centuries leading up to the founding of the United States. It is thinking that that the U.S. Constitution is all just about us as individuals that will lead to all of us losing freedom because forget the Constitution&rsquo;s true purpose of restraining government.</p>

If that Samsung chip doesn&rsquo;t match the performance of Qualcomm&rsquo;s then Google&rsquo;s own watch will not be a flagship.</p>

			 <p>Dear world, or at least anyone who cares, particularly the media. In the United States based on how the Constitution is structured, and how the political parties take advantage of its deficiencies through gerrymandering, lobbying, and campaign financing, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/06/majority-of-public-disapproves-of-supreme-courts-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/">majority opinions do not matter</a>.</p>
<p>The United States is effectively under authoritarian Republican rule overseen by six Supreme Court justices, and it is obviouse the Republicans don&rsquo;t care about any polls that report anything about majority opinion. It only matters what those in power in the Republican party want because they only need Republican votes to stay in power.</p>
<p>Right now what you need to pay attention to is, how are state legislatures structured and are voting districts gerrymandered to favor on particular party over another. If gerrymandering exists, what is being done about it, either through the courts or the existing legistlatures? Citizens need to know their state constitutions and what power they have for referendums, etc.. to overcome the games being played by the parties, particularly Republicans.</p>
<p>In short everyone, in particular the media, need to pay attention to and put bright light on what is going on within the state legistlatures and courts. Every since the last Presidential election Republicans have gamed the systems to gain even more power to basically nullify the will of the people. In many cases, gerrymandering means it won&rsquo;t matter how much this pisses off Democrats and Independents.</p>
<p>Where we are heading toward, as will likely be supported by the current Supeme Court, are <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained">state legistlatures having near absolute power</a> to override the citizens of the state to select Presidents. We will need an equivalent to <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/17th-amendment">the 17th amendment</a> to prevent this from happening because this Supreme Court is going to say it is powerless to do anything about it.</p>

			 <p>In a way, gerrymandering is baked in to the constitution by way of the Electoral College. Consequently, the idea of democrats moving to already blue states <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/03/gavin-newsom-florida-gop-attack-ad">like the California governor suggests</a> does not help the cause. Most Republicans will be more than happy to have all Democrats living in California and Massachusetts because they will then easily retain power with less populated but electorally powerful states. The problem right now is that Democrats are too centralized in urban areas. Elections in the United States are not based on population, which is why Republicans win presidencies and can always have a chokehold on the Senate and instill minority rule.</p>

			 <p>How it began, but we don&rsquo;t want to face history thus appear destined to repeat it.</p>
<p>“In 1544, Sepulveda wrote a manuscript justifying the wars against the Amerindians, based largely on what he saw as their inferiority. In it, his thinking is strictly hierarchical; he considers the Spanish Empire, like the Roman Empire, to be entitled to subjugate barbarians in order to civilize them. He regards the Amerindians as inferior to the Spanish, and, following Aristotelian concepts, declares them barbarians, incompetent to govern themselves, and destined to serve. War is necessary to Christianize them.&quot;”</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all the fact that the congressmen got around the sticky little problem of Black and Indigenous slavery by defining “men” as “white men,” and for all that it never crossed their minds that women might also have rights, the Declaration of Independence was an astonishingly radical document. <strong>In a world that had been dominated by a small class of rich men for so long that most people simply accepted that they should be forever tied to their status at birth, a group of upstart legislators on the edges of a continent declared that no man was born better than any other.</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except that far too many in the United States, some who even call themselves Christian, do not believe this. For them there is a natural, divine order that places particular white men above other white men, women, people of color, and everything else on this planet. You find these men in Russia, in the Vatican, and in the United States.</p>
<p>“Four score and seven years ago,” Abraham Lincoln reminded Americans, “our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” In 1863, Lincoln explained, the Civil War was “<strong>testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.</strong>”</p>
<p>Truth is, the test Lincoln describes began the moment it started on July 4, 1776 and has never ended since, particularly after the Civil War. During the 20th century the test expanded beyond the shores of the United States to the entire world. Those who think World War II decisively ended the test are sadly mistaken. The U.S. has been lucky the two world wars were not started or fought within the continent, but I fear the next one will start right here and by our own who cannot abide the disorder that freedom demands.</p>

			 <p>I believe <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/01.html#a133321">this will be a growing sentiment</a> about Christianity, and it will be deserved. We are doing things very wrong. Jesus never imposed his teaching on anyone, and he taught his followers to not be like those of the world who lord over others. Words and laws do not transform anything, only a better alternative way is truly transformative, and that is what the kin-dom of God is all about! Anything else is not truly good news.</p>

			 <p>If Republicans were rational, smart, and intune with the majority of the nation that includes the minorities they court, they would reach out to Democrats to craft a bi-partisan bill that wrote the right for all Amercians to chose what happens to and within their bodies, including women&rsquo;s right th chose an abortion up to X number of weeks, in to law. It would undercut a building backlash, make them look like doing something Democrats cannot do, and and showing they can govern.</p>

			 <p>I think that the Democratic Party devolved into being ndearly identical to Repubicans when it ended it&rsquo;s relationship with unions in the 90s. We are feeling the consequences of the Bill Clinton years during which Clinton assimilated Republican ideas like NAFTA and welfare reform for the sake of staying in office and thus retaining power. Clinton&rsquo;s argument to Democrats is you have to be in power to affect change, but the consequence was a near equivalency to Republicans. Now Democrats are unable to fight for anything because their real constituency is the same capitalists as the Republicans.</p>
<p>In the past, <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties_in_the_United_States#:~:text=There%20are%20over%20420%20registered,parties%2C%20the%20Republicans%20and%20Democrats.">replacement parties</a> would evolve as a fix to when a party goes off the rails, but with the current election laws and the amount of money they involve, the power class has a strangelhold on the United States. The Supreme Court, particularly as it is constructed, is all about returning the country to when capitalists had no restrictions.</p>

What I learned in high school civics is that the United States Constitution established checks and balances against the three branches of government, but what is the real check against the Supreme Court? Lifetime appointments with no qualification requirements and no term limits enables tyranny when five members always make the same decisions. Citizens have no recourse but absorb the brunt of the decisions. Only Congress can impeach or add justices. By definition, that makes SCOTUS the most problematic of the branches of government and why it became the prize of the right.</p>

			 <p>The way of Jesus is not a direct confrontation with evil. Why? It is because when you directly confront evil one becomes evil. We have seen this in modern times with the bombing of abortion clinics, and we will likely see it now in attacks on churches and other “pro-life” institutions. Instead, the way of Jesus, which he called the kingdom of God, is an alternative to evil. In reaction to the bad, it is a practice of the better. One resists evil by loving everyone and seeing them as a part of themselves they do not yet know.</p>
<p>Making abortion illegal will not stop abortion. Why? Because laws are reactive. Laws are not an alternative path rather they are a way for society to hold one accountable. Laws do not stop evil. Nearly all of Paul’s teaching is about this shortcoming of laws. Christianity would know this best if it truly had the mind of Christ and followed Jesus as a movement rather than be a reflection of the human empire that assimilated it into an institution.</p>
<p>Jesus would not be impressed by the overturning of Roe for he would recognize it for what it is, putting new wine in to old wine skins. Jesus would have the church focus on the kingdom, the alternative to evil, a reality on earth as it is in heaven. Today Christian churches may feel victorious, not realizing that while they may have won the battle, they are losing the war as more and more people see it for what is, no different than all the other institutions of man.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What is liberty? It seems to me that at this time the fundamental ideas that birthed the United States is not known or being outright ignored. For me, at it&rsquo;s core liberty is the right to control what happens to me. The Bill of Rights enumerates certain rights that allow me to speak and practice religion without personal consequences like being put in jail.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights protects me from the government, but it does not give me the right to harm others or take away the rights of others because I disagree, even if the practice of those rights conflicts with my beliefs. The first amendment does NOT give a Christian the right to enforce their beliefs on a Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, or atheist. (I do not see how one can make the argument of life beginning at conception without using religious belief.)</p>
<p>The ninth amendment of the Bill of Rights clearly states that it is not the intent of the Constitution to enumerate all rights of citizens, in fact it says <strong>if the right is not enumerated it is retained by the citizens.</strong></p>
<p>I thought that the ninth amendment and the inalienable, natural, rights declared in the Declaration of Independence were core beliefs of conservatives, but I guess that is not true for that which they do not like.</p>
<p>The Dobbs decision puts men and women at risk. Not only by what Clarence Thomas wrote but also because of the fact that it seems to go out of its way to say there is no right to control what happens to your body. Don&rsquo;t like vaccines? To bad, that don&rsquo;t matter that vaccine is for the greater good. Yes you have to wear that mask. Need welfare? Not going to give it to you until you get that vasectomy because we can&rsquo;t afford paying for more kids.</p>
<p>If we truly held to what liberty means and fully agreed to equal protection under the law, we shouldn&rsquo;t need to have an amendment that gives all citizens the right to choose what happens to and inside their body. It is the amendment we now need it seems and something that everyone should be able to support.</p>
<p>Does liberty truly exist in the United States? Is it really the land of the free? Unfortunately it appears that until this is enumerated in the Constitution certain Supreme Court justices and politicians will not abide nor defend that for which we stand.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Question. If U.S. citizens don’t have the right to choose what happens to their body, couldn’t the government then mandate abortions? Given how everything in the U.S. is based on monetary value, I think it likely that someone will realize forced abortions is cheaper than paying for unwanted children. Taking away protections from government has far greater risk to liberty than acknowledging rights, which I think is fundamental to the ninth amendment.</p>

<p>I think the answer is the same as to the question of why the Attorney General has not already filed charges against Trump. Fear of retaliation. Fear that doing so will be what pushes us over the cliff towards that civil war.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2022/05/25/you-will-hear.html">Last week I wrote</a> about how the problem with gun violence in the U.S. is not so much with those in political office as much as it is with those who keep electing those people in to office. I should have noted then about how gerrymandering, which is being completely ignored by the Supreme Court, is contributing to the battle between the states that frankly is destroying democracy. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/07/gerrymandering-abortion-roe-v-wade-ohio?utm_source=pocket_mylist">The Guardian addresses this topic</a> in terms of abortion, but the same applies to guns.. It points to the hypocrisy of a Supreme Court that says such decisions should be made by legislatures but does nothing to maintain fairness of representation that is necessary for a functioning democracy.</p>

<p>For evil to flourish, good men forget who they are. They forget the ideals they once swore to give their very lives for.

They come to see education and intellect as &ldquo;elitism&rdquo; and they begin to regard duty and the obligations of civilization itself as oppression. They raise up ignorance, hate, and especially violent rage as strengths and sneer in contempt at compassion, charity, and selflessness.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling <a href="https://www.stonekettle.com/2015/06/bang-bang-sanity.html">the article I linked to yesterday</a> that makes suggestions for practical gun safety based on the NRA&rsquo;s safety rules. And I suspect that one may think to themselves, how would gun safety laws help decrease the amount of gun violence in the United States. And here from the article is the point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well written laws are about pragmatism.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, we all know that laws against drinking and driving won’t stop drunk driving, but they weren’t intended to. We know it’s going to happen. People are going to drink and drive and kill themselves and each other. We know we can’t eliminate it completely. That’s the pragmatism part.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, drunk driving laws were intended to do two things, 1) give us legal recourse as a society, 2) make us responsible for our antisocial behavior – which in turn leads over time to a change in culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And that change significantly, measurably, reduced drinking and driving and provably saved lives and made American roads a safer place for all of us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But, and this is important so pay attention, here’s what those laws didn’t do: they didn’t keep those of us who take responsibility for our own actions from 1) drinking, or 2) driving (note the operative word here is or).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And that’s the answer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We need gun laws that give society legal recourse by making each gun owner/user personally accountable for their own actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most sane people, pro gun law or anti gun law, will at least acknowledge that gun violence is way out of control in the United States. We have a societal problem. The problem has been getting worse for a decade and no laws have been passed to address it. What message, what permission, does the very act of not doing anything have on society? I think it says, the current state is ok. Keep on with the killing no matter whether it is in a school, a church, or a movie theatre.</p>

			 <p>You will hear pundits quote polling that suggests a majority of citizens want tougher gun control laws, like you hear that a majority of citizens do not want abortion to be illegal. While that information might be true, it does not reflect how a bill becomes a law in the United States. In short, that polling information is really useless because laws are not passed the U.S. as a nation.</p>
<p>Every state has two senators, no matter how many citizens it has, and if not more than 60 Senators are willing to vote in favor of a law, the law will not be passed, even if it passes the House which more accurately reflects the population of the United States. So, the right polling should be per state.</p>
<p>We tend to obviscate by classifying states as red or blue, when in reality is you have states that are &ldquo;pro no restraints on guns over loss of life&rdquo; and other states that are &ldquo;pro restraints on guns to prevent loss of life.&rdquo; Citizens in these states who keep re-electing Senators over and over again have created the current situation.</p>
<p>So today, right now the question isn&rsquo;t, what is the Unites States going to do. The real question is, what are the citizens of the state of Texas, who keep re-electing Ted Cruz over and over again, going to do? I am not optimistic.</p>
<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/25/ted-cruz-lawmakers-money-gun-rights-groups">no matter how much money the NRA gives Ted Cruz</a>, the NRA is not casting votes for him, it&rsquo;s the citizens in the state of Texas who cast those votes. Yes, the NRA bought all the past votes but that only works because Cruz is in office, and that only happens because more citizens of Texas vote for him than someone else who will vote for common sense gun laws.</p>

			 <p>Every time another mass gun shooting takes place we direct our anger at lawmakers who refuse to pass gun control laws. Unfortunately, that anger is misplaced. How many times has citizens in the state of Kentucky re-elected Mitch McConnell after a shooting takes place? Truth is, the citizens in each state with Senators refusing to pass gun control laws that keep re-electing those Senators are the true people at fault. Citizens, you and I. Clearly, the citizens of Kentucky prefer the current situation as do far too many citizens in too many states, including the ones in which the shootings take place. <strong>Lawmakers do nothing because they know they do not have do anything, none of them are at risk of not being re-elected because they don&rsquo;t pass gun control laws.</strong> End of story. It&rsquo;s all on us, and that includes parents of children the same age as those killed yesterday.</p>

			 <p>Dear Constitutional Fundamentalists, Supreme Court Justics and conservative Republicans. How do you reconcile the claim that the government cannot mandate vaccines on the basis of protecting the public good because of your right to decide what happens to your body, a right apparently not natural and not explicitly in the Constitiution according to SCOTUS, and your claim that the government can mandate that a pregnant woman give birth to a baby?</p>
<p>I mean, there is liikely going to be another pandemic in the future that could result in millions of dead people due to the inactions of others, either we, all genders, all races, all humans, being equal, have the right to privacy that provides us the right to decide what happens to and inside our bodies, or we do not. You cannot have it both ways.</p>
<p>Or is it that we are not all equal and thus do not deserve equal protection under the law?</p>

			 <p>Is recognizing rights of citizens in the United States a bad thing? My understanding of the United States Constitution is that its purpose is to prevent the Federal government from becoming tyrannical by narrowing its power to enumerated rights. The Constitution does not exist to define the rights of citizens and <strong>I am pretty sure Madison did not imagine that the Bill of Rights defined the only rights of U.S. citizens.</strong> Therefore it seems to me that the very act of removing rights from citizens through declaring that SCOTUS decisions granted rights not provided for in the Constitution is the exact opposite of an originalist understanding of the Constitution. Roe v. Wade restrains the Federal government from taking a women&rsquo;s right of autonomy over their own body, a right by the way that many of been claiming is the reason why things like &ldquo;mask mandates&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccine mandates' are not constitutional.</p>

I think the wealthy like Musk are concerned about the negative reputation toward and potential cancel culture of the wealthy. Owning Twitter assures he can&rsquo;t get kicked off the platform no matter what he writes, so he can freely write things like how bad a wealth tax would be. In other words, owning Twitter is about controlling the narrative for Musk. Also, if Musk owns Twitter Trump will be back on Twitter.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve received my new <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/ipad-mini-6">iPad Mini 6</a> and I am working through setting it up. I opted to transfer apps, settings and data directly from the iPad Mini 5. First hoop I had to jump is getting through the  update to iPadOS 15.4.1, which took several minutes to download and update.</p>
<p>Next thing I notice is that all of widgets on the home screen are all blank white boxes with no obvious fix. First I restarted the iPad, but that didn&rsquo;t fix the problem. I then realized that while I see all the app icons, the apps are not installed so I need to start up each of the apps associated with the widgets.</p>
<p>I basically have to reinstall every app I use which is a really painful process that I cannot believe Apple foists upon users. And the process is made worse by the spotty nature of the App Store that right now is refusing to install apps.</p>
<p>So, it is going to probably take several days for me to get this Mini fully up to speed.</p>

Imagine he owns Twitter and then runs for President of the United States. Would he be forced to divest? A precident was set with Trump. If the sale proceeds there should be conditions that if he were to run for office he would have to divest, but I doubt that will happen.</p>
<p>In my eyes a Trump versus Musk Republican primary is lose/lose, but I can see that happen. I think it says a lot when the oligarchs are seeking the office.</p>
<p>I also think the reaction and any action if the sale happens may reinforce <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2022/04/13/ive-read-jonathan.html">my view</a> of how American society is addicted to wealth and power.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s essay, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Have Been Uniquely Stupid</a>. I can summarize Haidt by saying the algorithms in social media are destroying our democratic society. We have devolved in to the very things that James Madison feared when writing the Constitution.</p>
<p>While Haidt makes many good points I don&rsquo;t think he gets to the root cause, which I think is our acceptance that it is ok for corporations to make money from addiction.</p>
<p>In the United States we want to put all the blame of one&rsquo;s problem on themselves. Thus, the only problem with addiction is the addict and the consequences they bring upon themselves. Too many industries like  technology, food, service/fast food, alcohol, health, and pharamceutical all profit from addiction. You should note the fundamental nature of these industries.</p>
<p>Even after lawsuits and public trials against the tobacco industry that exposed it knew nicotine is addictive and knew it causes cancer and yet still made money off of selling cigarettes, we give every industry with a business model that uses addiction to maximize profit and wealth a free pass. In the United States it is ok for someone to make a buck off the death of another, and somehow there are even &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; in this country who consider themselves pro-life.</p>
<p>In the beginning Facebook and Twitter did not make money, it wasn&rsquo;t until they introduced algorithms to force content in front of users that they began making money. Research is showing the algorithms are optimized for addiction. And still I think you will find many people in the United States point the finger at people who use these networks as solely to blame and unwilling to restrict Facebook or Twitter from making money because we believe nobody should be restricted from making money.</p>
<p>The United States was founded upon the basic concept of freedom, and frankly that concept is no longer the prime directive of the United States. Today the United States is entirely driven by capitalism and the prime directive is to make a few people very rich, and a few rich people don&rsquo;t need nor really want democracy, they just want the citiizens to be free to spend more and more money on their products.</p>
<p>Everybody knows money is the problem, but like an addict that just can&rsquo;t do what is in their best interests, nobody is going to do anything about it. Sadly, like most addicts we know, I don&rsquo;t think our country will seriously address our problems until we hit rock bottom, and I fear for what such a bottom will look like for a country that has accepted children being killed in schools and people in power acting to overthrow the government.</p>

<p>I remember a time when shortstops were considered the worst batter in the lineup and that didn&rsquo;t matter because shortstops were considered the best athlete and most important defensive player on the team. Ozzie Smith didn&rsquo;t make is his mark at the plate, he was known as the Wizard because of his defense. I always felt too much attention is paid to Baez&rsquo;s inconsistency at the plate and not enough value placed on his defense, which I think is worth enough to absorb his bat.</p>
<p>Baez was not the problem in the Cubs lineup, the problem was that everyone else in the lineup was not much better. Put Baez in a lineup with other players who make contact and get on base and you can live with his strikeouts, and revel in his ability in the big moments. I think in some ways Baez is like Brett Farve, high risk and high reward. The defense, and in particular Reggie White, made Farve who he was for the Packers because it could overcome his interceptions. Put Farve on the Detroit Lions and he is not a hall of fame player.</p>
<p>I am happy that even though Javier is no longer playing for the Cubs, he is playing for a team in my area that is on TV every day. Baez is the type of player you tune in just to watch, regardless of your interest in the team, much like Cabrera was in his prime. Tiger fans need to remember the incredible plays that he has already made in four games when he strikes out in that crticial moment in July because it will happen and he will still be worth every bit of money he is paid.</p>

			 <p>Today the Chicago Cubs, well actually mostly the Cub&rsquo;s farm system, will play the last 2022 spring training game and will go in to the new season with <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cubs/standings/spring-training">a winning spring training record</a>. Of course, nobody wins a World Series in spring training, even if my attendance at the 2016 spring training might have propelled the Cubs to win it all that year.</p>
<p>It looks like the Cubs have improved, and I expect they will be competitive enough to make them interesting to watch. One concerning sign from the  spring is they allowed more runs than scored, and run scoring (offense) is the big question mark.</p>

			 <p>I am a Chicago Cubs fan who lives in southeast Michigan. When I first moved here in 1989 I couldn&rsquo;t watch the Cubs unless they were on national TV, so I did take an interest in watching the local Detroit Tigers broadcast. When the MLB.tv and MLB At Bat app became available I could again watch every Cubs game and therefore I don&rsquo;t watch as much of the Detroit Tigers. I also tend to not watch the national broadcast games.</p>
<p>All of the above is background to me wondering just how successful the streaming of &ldquo;national broadcast&rdquo; games will be on Apple TV. Fourty years ago there were more national broadcast of baseball games at a time when there were no regional nor local broadcasts and no Internet streaming. Baseball does not have the same national draw as the NFL and the Cubs play every Friday. I doubt this will happen, but I&rsquo;ll be really mad if they don&rsquo;t stream the games in MLB.tv on Fridays.</p>
<p>So, for myself, the only time I will watch the Friday night games on Apple TV is when the Cubs play, and I suspect most other people will do the same. I just don&rsquo;t see this working out well for Apple, particularly when Apple decides to block access to only Apple TV subscribers. Right now people do not subscribe to Apple TV to watch baseball. MLB will probably be ok because I am sure they are getting paid by Apple regardless of the number of viewers.</p>
<p>In the meantime I read that the NFL might start their own streaming service, so I wonder whether I will be able to see more Green Bay Packer games?</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s somewhat shocking to me that after more than 200 years we seem to still not have decided in the United States whether we are one country or whether <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/mike-braun-says-interracial-marriage-should-be-illegal-1325336/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">we are something more like the European Union</a>.

			 <p>War should not be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/opinions/watching-ukraine-war-on-screen-hemmer/index.html">watched or consumed as entertainment</a>. One ought to consider how it is that one or a few people can make the decision to start a war with seemingly little to no regard for loss of human life and the suffering it causes. I think at the heart of it is the sin of supremacy that convinces that the other&rsquo;s life is not valuable nor legitimate.</p>
<p>Even in democracies, as we know all too well in the United States, one man or woman has the power to wage war.  We have decided that expediency is so important we must empower one human to such power, a power that frankly we should never allow to just one human.</p>
<p>The power to wage war and it&rsquo;s consequences is why character matters so much when deciding which human should be elected President of the United States. Anyone who treats the power to wage war as a political tool should never be allowed to hold the office.</p>

			 <p>Something is fundamentally wrong in a democracy that has all the energy around laws to restrict voting rather than expand voting. We should be embarrassed that so few people actually vote, but as has been the case since the beginning the system is built to be run by an elite few. It is said the United States is a republic or a representative democracy, but who is really represented and who is not represented is the metastasis destroying the country from the inside out.</p>

<p>Instead of seeing versions of hearsay (non-institutional systems of news and analysis) as damaging institutional systems, we could choose to see the hearsay system itself as the thing under attack. That is, in the age of social media, a valuable system of non-institutional knowledge is increasingly gameable and gamed, rendered useless by a variety of threats and incentives that are polluting not the institutional space, but the hearsay space.</p>

			 <p>In the United States, democracy is less about the form of government and more about an aspiration. The idea of true equality of all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation was simply not comprehensible to the U.S. founders or their contemporaries. Interestingly, I think James Madison recognized the imperfections of the United States when he wrote these words in the preamble to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We the People of the United States, in Order <strong>to form a more perfect Union</strong>, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To me a &ldquo;more perfect union&rdquo; is not a declaration of an end state but rather a recognition that we can continue to become better. In other words, Madison expected the United States in 2022 to be more perfect than the United States in 1780 because the Constitution provides the framework for that improvement. It does this by providing for amendments that improve upon the original work.</p>

			 <p>The scary reality is that the future of the Republic may very much ride on the Republican Presidential Primaries in 2024. The Republican party enabled Trump to become President thus only it,  or better said only it&rsquo;s corporate and wealthy backers, can prevent him from being their nominee in 2024. In short, most of the anti-Trump, anti-fascist rhetoric is coming from Democrats, but they don&rsquo;t have the real power to prevent it from happening again, particularly when the country is split 50/50 between the two parties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, unless GOP voters are polarized against the extreme right, and turnout for Republican primary contests increases dramatically, the party could continue to be a vehicle for building this hard-right base at the state level and in congressional races. The poll numbers certainly suggest that these forces have plenty of room to organize and recruit. <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/01/capitol-building-riot-business-trump?utm_source=pocket_mylist">source</a></p>

			 <p>My guess is that many of us view this day differently, and yet others think it overwrought. To me the heart of the matter is the elevation of individualism to a religion. You might call it American Christianity.

			 <p>In my opinion too many U.S. citizens do not have an understanding of the country&rsquo;s foundational documents, particularly <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Declaration of Independence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

<p>So I think that it’s better to ask people: “Based on your own self-interest as you yourself define your self-interest, how do you expect this to work out? How do you expect the world to look in 2060 or 2070 or 2080? And how do you expect to shield yourself and your family from the world?”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think a lot of people&rsquo;s answer to the above is, I don&rsquo;t care, I&rsquo;ll be dead. We have been conditioned for short term thinking over the last five decades.</p>

			 <p>I am only aware of one country in the world that took conscious steps to address the cancer of supremacy, that country is South Africa. It&rsquo;s path toward the task of overcoming supremacy was long and likely incomplete but would probably not have been taken up at all if not for Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu.</p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/desmond-tutu-dead-a0cec6cddaa5cf2a996df8550a72479c">News of Tutu&rsquo;s death</a> makes me wonder how he saw the United States. Tutu had the wisdom to know that the antidote to supremacy is oneness, ubuntu. Supremacy cannot be shunned as it will simply continue lurking in the shadows. The only way to eliminate contempt is to see everyone as a part of me I do not yet know.</p>
<p>I feel as though the entire United States needs to be in a 12 step program. We cannot begin to overcome that which we don&rsquo;t even acknowledge. We hide our addiction with our liberties. The <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">amount of death that we have grown to accept</a>, the amount of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/28/us/denver-shooting-officer-injured/index.html">senseless loss of life we tolerate</a> are not signs of a great nation or society.</p>
<p>The United States is leading the world into a third year of a pandemic that will continue to take more lives unnecessarily, and United States continues to lead the world in gun violence. All we are doing is managing to get by for just one more day. Apparently we have not yet hit bottom even after children are gun down in schools.</p>
<p>South Africa did not start to overcome the addiction of supremacy known as apartheid until it consciously did something about it. Any expert on addiction will tell you that no person can be made to overcome their addiction, the addict must decide for themselves they want to live. We, the citizens of the United States of America need to decide whether this republic handed down to us is something we want to keep, and that takes all of us to take a long look at ourselves and see us as we are rather than as how we keep telling ourselves.</p>

In the past, when in the dark always on display would dim but stay on enough to be seen and I woke up I could see the time. For the last several nights now the display has turned off and I don&rsquo;t know why.

When at my desk I am connecting the Macbook to a 32 inch BenQ monitor via a USB-C dock and because I am using the Macbook&rsquo;s keyboard, the monitors are arranged in System Preferences Displays settings as vertically stacked, with the external display above the internal display. I have the external display set as the primary but what has been frustrating is that the OS X dock doesn&rsquo;t automatically move up to the primary display. I cannot believe that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to move the mouse to the bottom left of the external monitor<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to get the dock to move when OS X seems to be smart enough to know which menu bar is active on which display; seems to me on which ever screen the menu bar is active that is the display that should have the dock. Testing shows that the issue only seems to be with vertical stacking of the displays (so I move the mouse up/down between displays) and not when the monitors are horizontally arranged (move the mouse right/left between displays).</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593230770">No Cure for Being Human: And Other Truths I Need to Hear</a> by Kate Bowler 📚 The writing in this book is all too relatable to me. A quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I believe that there may be rich meaning at every crossroad in our lives—each meeting and departure, car accident or chance encounter—I do not believe that God will provide for every need or prevent every sorrow. From my hospital room, I see no master plan to bring me to a higher level, guarantee my growth, or use my cancer to teach me. Good or bad, I will not get what I deserve. Nothing will exempt me from the pain of being human.</p>

<p>Most of us know and are faced daily with what is to be human but spend little time thinking about Being.</p>

			 <p>The more <!-- raw HTML omitted -->articles I read about COVID19<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the more frustrated I get with the lack of availability of affordable rapid testing in the United States. Throughout the pandemic we have suffered from the desire for certainty and perfection. Perfection is the enemy of the better. Rapid tests won&rsquo;t detect all cases, so they don&rsquo;t guarantee one is not infected, BUT if a rapid test is positive you then clearly know you are a threat to spreading the infection to others and should definitely stay home, which is more information than the average person has before they walk out the door.</p>

			 <p>I am connecting the Macbook Air to the BenQ Monitor, which I have configured as the primary display with the display extending to the internal display of the Macbook. I expect the macOS dock should appear on the BenQ but I haven&rsquo;t figured out how to make it consistently appear. It seems if I move the mouse cursor to just the right spot at the bottom of the display then the dock appears and stays, but not until then. If I move the mouse to the bottom of the internal display the dock then appears there and goes away from the BenQ. Given Apple&rsquo;s reputation, I am surprised by this inconsistent behavior.. or perhaps this is just user error?</p>

			 <p>Still think that replay should stop play and make calls on hits to the head in the NFL. In the last 10 minutes of the game tonight there have been two calls the refs have missed. Hits to the head is a player safety issue that the NFL should make maximum effort to get out of the game. Fines after the fact doesn&rsquo;t do the job. The NFL needs to follow the NCAA&rsquo;s lead in this, and frankly should be open to law suits from former players.</p>

			 <p>Comparing the battery life of my Pixel 4a to the Pixel 2 back when I made note of it <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/11/17/pixel2BatteryLife.html">four years ago</a>. Screen on is still at 5 hours, but screen off increased from 36 hours to 45 hours and combined increased from 26 hours to 36 hours. Obvious the combined hours is influenced by the increase in screen off and the screen off reflects the operating system optimizations. Screen on time tells me little has changed in screen power consumption.</p>

			 <p>While I am sympathetic to Dave Winer&rsquo;s critique of journalism in the United States, I am skeptical that <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/14/141902.html?title=aintTooProudToBlog#a152147">his recommended improvements</a> will make a difference. In my opinion the root cause problem of journalism is that it is beholden to the doctrine of capitalism. Everyone, regardless of party affiliation, believes that the prime objective of journalism in the United States is to make money and will bias what they publish towards that goal. Consider why it is that the titles for newspaper articles are usually not created by the person who wrote the article. Until the root cause is addressed I don&rsquo;t see how there will be improvements.</p>
<p>The sad fact is, everyone is well aware of how money has corrupted every part of our lives. Our skepticism toward industry such as medical and media, and our skepticism of politicians is all rooted in our awareness of this corruption. We are at a danger level now because people have very little trust in anyone not themselves, and yet our society requires the ability to trust.</p>

			 <p>I was in an actual computer store yesterday, which was momentous for two reasons. First is that I have not really spent much time in stores other than grocery stories since the pandemic began. Second is that it has been way too long since I had been in a real computer store.</p>
<p>One of my favorite stores of my childhood is <a href="https://www.radioshack.com/">Radioshack</a>, which was an electronics store from before personal computers were a thing that you could find in just about any town in the United States.</p>
<p>Radioshack on a larger scale describes <a href="https://frys.com/">Fry&rsquo;s</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompUSA">CompUSA</a>. In its prime you could probably find a CompUSA in most all metropolitan areas and I spent much time and money in the ones near where I lived. CompUSA is where I went to check out the newest computers and gadgets. It&rsquo;s where I bought my first Apple computer, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePad">Newton MessagePad</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, CompUSA and Fry&rsquo;s are extinct, victims of the one-two punch of the big box stores and the Internet. In my area of metropolitan Detroit one lone <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/">Microcenter</a> remains as a sanctuary of geekdom, which is where I found myself yesterday evening to pick up the new Macbook Air that I reserved online.</p>
<p>I nearly shed a tear when I walked through the doors to the sight of the picture below. I walked slowly up and down each aisle, thankful for the mask covering my face that hid what I am sure was the goofy look of geek joy. Every computer component you can think of sat on shelves in rows you must pass through to get to the manufactured computers in the back of the store.</p>
<p>I confess that I have contributed to the demise of the very stores that I miss, buying all of my newest tech online and having it delivered to my front door. I had forgotten the pleasure of seeing all of this technology in front of me. Walking out the door I vowed to not wait so long before returning.</p>

			 <p>While thinking about how I use <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">micro.blog</a> and how I am using <a href="http://daynotes.frankm.info">Drummer</a> it occurs to me that both blogging platforms have the same problem with handling what I call long form writing. The root cause is the publishing of the full content of every blog post, regardless of whether the post has a title, on the home page.</p>
<p>To my eyes it makes no sense embedding a titled post that has multiple paragraphs on the home page because it just makes the home page too long. The reader ends up scrolling further and further down a page. Another problem is the reader sees these entries as just another blog post whereas I want such titled posts to be seen as a story or essay.</p>
<p>My ideal scenario would be a publishing platform that is smart enough to handle a couple of scenarios. One scenario would be to enable the writer to create what I will call an introduction post that has a title, a specific introduction that I wrote, and a link to the page with the full article. The idea is that a story, or essay, stands alone on its own page and one is simply writing a blog post to link to that page. Micro.blog even has a pages option that could support this, but it&rsquo;s not integrated in the manner that I am suggesting.</p>
<p>The other scenario, or approach, would be for the blogging platform to just automatically limit a titled post on the man page to the title and three sentences, with a cut and a read more link.  I emphasize I don&rsquo;t want a publishing platform that requires titled posts, I want it to smartly handled untitled and titled posts and not necessarily treat them the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always held that a blog post is only one, maybe two paragraphs long and something longer is different, what I call stories but others may call essays. This very item you are reading right now is an essay, not a blog post, it just happens to be published on blogging platform. In fact, perhaps what I am advocating is for a web publishing platform that is more than a blog publishing platform.</p>
<p>I can manually implement this approach by only writing <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/">blog posts here</a> and publishing stories <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/">on another site</a>, but that forces me to maintain two sites and use two different writing flows that I have find fatiguing. My desire is to use one writing and publishing flow for both forms of writing.</p>

			 <p>I write many of my blog posts on this site using the <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts app</a> on my iPad, and I can do that because micro.blog supports an open API that provides the ability to integrate any editor to it. In this manner micro.blog is the most open platform that I have used. In fact that means I can even use <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com">Drummer</a> to write and publish a post to this site. The irony is, I cannot do the reverse as there is no way for me to write a post in Drafts to be published to my <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/?tab=blog">Daynotes</a>. The cause in my opinion is that Dave is focused on a file format rather than an API.</p>

I know that as a fan I am supposed to want my team to win it all every year, but even though since 2016 the Cubs have ultimately lost in the playoffs those loses were not as crushing in context of 2016. The Cubs NLCS loses in 1984, 1989, and 2003 were crushing as I had never seen them in the World Series. I&rsquo;ll always be bitter about 1984 because frankly, they were the best National League team that year and should have played the Tigers.</p>

			 <p>I was having a problem with my iPad Mini in that links to web sites that should load from other apps like email do not load. The problem also affects the ability to load hotel captive portal pages, which means I couldn’t connect this iPad to the Internet in some hotels. The problem appears to be NextDNS, which while I had disabled it in the app the DNS settings were still pointing to it. After I changed the DNS setting to automatic I could open the captive portal page.</p>

			 <p>When I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->compare the Pixel 6 to my Pixel 4a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the differences in the camera really jump out. I confess that given the price and the features that if I were in the market for a new phone I would be buying the Pixel 6. BTW, I really like that Google provides a way to compare the current and new Pixel phones with the old Pixels, all the way back to the first Pixel. Wish they would include the Nexus phones for comparison. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to find the Pixel 6 so attractive.</p>

			 <p>My main beef with the Pixel 6 is that it is a tad too large. The largest phone I have carried is the Nexus 6P, which was 6.27 inches tall and a little over 3 inches wide, and while I got used to it I always felt it too large. When Google released the Pixel 2 I frankly couldn&rsquo;t switch fast enough because it was 5.74 inches tall and a little skinnier at 2.74 inches wide. The Pixel 4a I now carry has the same physical size with a larger screen that I find perfect. Sadly, the Pixel 5a is now the smallest Google phone at 6.1 inches and the new Pixel 6 is at 6.2 inches. I have never carried a phone as large as the new Pixel 6 Pro that is 6.5 inches tall. I fear we may never see a sub 6 inch Pixel phone again, but at least the larger phones have larger batteries.</p>

			 <p>My first impression having watched the ending of the presentation is that Google has hit it out of the park with this release of Android 12 and the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. I&rsquo;ve been running Android 12 for several weeks and I really like all of the UI improvements. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are priced very favorably and is going to put to test the question of whether a well designed Android phone can seriously compete with the iPhone. It looks like Google is all-in on marketing the Pixel 6. The question is, when one walks in to a Best Buy or a AT&amp;T store which phone do people in those stores steer customers toward? Another question is going to be build quality. Google has suffered in the past with defective devices that leave bad impressions so they must step up their quality control game. Only time will tell.</p>

At this point I am not sure if one way is significantly better than the other. What I really want is an application that acts for me like a switchboard where I can specific to which channels I want an item posted. I can post to micro.blog from eternal apps, but there is no API with Old School to enable the same. Those who read Dave should see some irony in this fact.</p>

			 <p>To me <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com">Drummer</a> is the next version of <a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>, but that is only relevant to people like me who used Fargo. One enters and manages content in an outline, which has the same UI as <a href="http://littleoutliner.com">Little Outliner</a>. One can use Drummer to create and maintain a blog that is generated (published) based on a OPML file and a CSS, Javascript and HTML template. Hosting of the front end Editor and backed publisher and web content is currently being provided by Dave Winer, who is the application developer.</p>
<p>One can associate a unique URL to the location where the generated blog content is stored using <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/11/135025.html?title=pageparkBuildsAgain">PagePark</a>. In this instance PagePark is basically acting as a reverse proxy, none of your content is stored on your own server.</p>
<p>Dave does provide Mac version of the Drummer front end that is based on Electron. He may provide Windows and Linux versions of the app. The Electron version of the app will enable you to store and edit your source content OPML files on your own computer, but from what I can tell the published content will still be hosted on Dave&rsquo;s server.</p>
<p>From what I have read, the desktop version of Drummer is intended to be near to or equal to the OPML Editor. For my purposes it is most desirable to have the desktop version of this application.</p>
<p>Final note, a check of the source to the HTML file of the blog shows that nearly all of the &ldquo;script src&rdquo; tags have been changed and it looks like if one hosts PagePark on a server/container that supports HTTPS you might have success in accessing the blog via HTTPs.</p>

Two things I am interested to learn, one is how is the backend hosting handled the other is the level of integration with Radio3.  I do think it&rsquo;s disappointing that this is another, new blogging platform that does not support HTTPS. While theew is the appearance of fighting &ldquo;the man&rdquo; (Google) the reality is soon it will become harder for users to read what is published to this platform because ALL major browsers will make it harder for users to access sites that don&rsquo;t use HTTPS. The sad thing is that at this point it is much easier to support HTTPS so don&rsquo;t real there is a real good excuse for not doing it.</p>

			 <p>Happy <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">Windows 11 day</a>! I&rsquo;ve spent the last several days experimenting with the ARM Version of Windows 11 on a Raspberry Pi 4. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-windows-11-raspberry-pi">The installation process</a> is pretty easy thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/Botspot/wor-flasher">WoR-Flasher</a> utility, which I used to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; an installation image to a SSD. At first I tried installing by simply using USB drive, and while that worked I wondered whether using a SSD would be better. I ended up buying an inexpensive Crucial SSD and a 3.1 USB enclosure, which isn&rsquo;t going to be as fast a direct PCIe connection, but the combo does time out faster than the thumb drive. One challenge I had was making sure the power adapter of the Pi was providing enough power for the drive, which I resolved once I used <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-power-supply.html">the 3.5A USB C power adapter from CanaKit</a>. One constraint is that the Windows 11 build does not work with the Pi 4&rsquo;s WiFi. I don&rsquo;t know how long this version of Windows 11 will last, from what I read the update process is not smooth and may require a re-build, which will wipe out a product activation.</p>
<p>During this process I learned about differences between SATA and NVME SSD drives and found a really helpful <a href="https://jamesachambers.com/new-raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-usb-network-boot-guide/">guide about the Pi 4 bootloader and USB mass storage</a>. I also found a very extensive <a href="https://pibenchmarks.com/">site of performance benchmarks</a> of mass storage connected to Raspberry Pis.</p>

			 <p>Found the reason for why the Chrome OS Files app on my Pixelbook was taking so long to load the file system. There were SMB share mappings that became corrupt and basically Files was trying to access those shares but would eventually time out. Unfortunately, the corruption prevented me from removing the shares via the UI and there is no known way to manually remove them, so I had to powerwash the Pixelbook.</p>
<p>Powerwash restores Chromebooks to their factory default state, and because all of the apps and settings for Chromebooks are in the cloud, the restore process is pretty quick, even with Android apps installed. If you do have Linux apps installed, which I do, that does require a traditional backup and restore, but restoring a container such as Chrome OS uses for Linux makes that restore process pretty quick and straightforward.</p>
<p>My personal experience with this process confirms to me why Chromebooks are so popular with schools, the restore process for them is probably the easiest and fastest of any device you can put your hands on.</p>

			 <p>Back when there were several book store chains and plenty of stores I spent a fair amount of time in them and in particular looking through the computer magazine section. Magazines were a big part of my formative computing years, and I looked forward to each month&rsquo;s issue of <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine">Byte</a>. The magazines were not only a source of news about the latest hardware and software, they were also a means of software distribution containing pages of source code available to manually enter on a variety of computer platforms.</p>
<p>Physical book stores are nearly extinct and computer magazines shrank in to oblivion, replaced by the Internet, but I have found one corner of the Internet where computer magazines still live. You may have heard of the Raspberry Pi, which is an inexpensive &ldquo;computer on a chip&rdquo;  popular amongst makers. What you might not know is that raspberrypi.org is more than just the computer hardware, it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/">foundation dedicated towards computer education</a>. The foundation publishes tutorials and lesson plans for teachers and it has a publishing arm for books and magazines.</p>
<p>Four different magazines are <a href="https://store.rpipress.cc">published</a>: HackSpace, Custom PC, Wireframe, and The MagPi, which you can subscribe to and purchase online and in stores in the United Kingdom. Better yet, the magazines and books are free to download in PDF format.</p>
<p>If you own a Raspberry Pi and have the full desktop version of the operating system installed you will find a Bookshelf app in the Help menu of the desktop&rsquo;s application launcher. Bookshelf has tabs for each magazine and books that you can download and read on the Pi.  If you don&rsquo;t have a Pi you can <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/books-magazines/">browse through and download the PDFS</a> using the web browser on your computer.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Raspberry Pi you will find everything you need to know about it on their web site, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberrypi.org</a>.  Another great source for information is the <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/books/handbook-2022">Official Raspberry Pi Handbook</a>, and the 2022 version has been just released and available to download.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive starter computer for yourself or a child, I recommend <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/">the Raspberry Pi 400</a>, which is an &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; computer you can buy for $70. I also think anyone considering a future in computing, or just interested to learn more, should buy a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> kit, which you can assemble and use to learn more about computer hardware and software.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am contemplating purchasing a new laptop computer so that I can access and learn the latest operating systems. I am most interested in Window 11 because Windows is the primary operating system that I use every work day, but <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/11/how-universal-control-on-ipados-15-and-macos-12-works">the integrations</a> between iPadOS and MacOS also have me interested in a Mac. If I buy a Mac I can also <a href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/windows11/">run Windows 11 in a VM</a>, so that will provide me the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>So, I watched the Microsoft Event today to see whether Microsoft might announce something that will influence my purchase decision. My conclusion is none of the products announced today fit in the budget that I have in mind because of the add-ons one has to purchase to gain full functionality.</p>
<p>Microsoft did announce nice looking products today, but for me they have a real pricing problem. Take, for example, the new Surface Go 3. The lowest price version costs $399, which comes with 4 GB of RAM and only 64 GB of storage, which I really do not think is enough storage for any productivity device in 2021. Consequently, the lowest model I would consider is the mid-tier 8 GB RAM, 128 GB model at $549, but that only gets you the tablet. You will want to add a type cover that costs at least $100 and most likely a Surface Pen for another $70, for a grand total of $719, and that combo is with an Intel Pentium processor rather than the more powerful Intel Core i5 in the Surface Laptop Go. In my opinion Microsoft should include the type keyboard with the Surface Pro and Surface Go at their current price.</p>
<p>My research prior to the event tells me that the Microsoft product that most makes sense for a reasonable PC running Windows 11 is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-go/94fc0bdgq7wv?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Surface Laptop Go</a>. While it won&rsquo;t run MacOS, you can buy a well equipped model (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) for $800.</p>
<p>Thing is, I can also buy a <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac Mini</a> with the same memory, storage, and price and for less than $200 also have the ability to run Windows 11. Of course, the Mini is a desktop and my bias is toward the portability of a laptop, so that has me looking at a Macbook Air for $200 more, which is pushing the price a bit higher than I would like.</p>
<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t intend to make a decision until after the expected Apple Mac event that should happen in October. Rumors are a new Mac Mini and Macbook Pros will be announced, but not an Air. A new Macbook Pro might influence pricing of the current Airs. My ideal would be a new entry level Pro with 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSD starting at the current $1299 &ldquo;base&rdquo; price, which I think would mean Apple could drop the price of the current Airs by $100 to $200. The logic being it would not make sense to have the high end Air and the Low end Pro with the same specs and same price because nobody would by the high end Air. (The only reason to buy the high end Air over the Pro right now is the 512 GB storage at $50 less price!)</p>
<p>The other question is, what will be the specs for the new Mac Minis? In this case I expect the specs will remain the same, the prices will remain the same, and there will be a processor upgrade. However, the consequence there might be availability of the current Mac Minis at lower prices. An 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD model at nearly $600 is appealing.</p>
<p>One might think the reasoning I&rsquo;ve described above is an &ldquo;apples to oranges&rdquo; comparison. I see it as a &ldquo;get what I need&rdquo; versus an &ldquo;investment&rdquo; comparison. I bought my last Macbook Air 15 years ago, and it still functions! It&rsquo;s really slow compared to most devices today, but what that experience tells me is that buying an Apple laptop or desktop realistically gets me 5 to 7 years of use. I can buy a cheaper laptop to just run Windows 11 but it probably gets me 4 years of real use.</p>
<p>So, now we wait for the next Apple event. Traditionally Apple has held two events in the fall, one in September to announce new iPhones, which they did, and one in October featuring Macs and iPads, thus one more event to gather information for making my purchase decision.</p>

			 <p>And here you thought pumpkin spice was for fall, no it&rsquo;s operating system season! Yesterday Apple released <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/">iOS and iPadOS Version 15</a>, and coming up October is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android Version 12</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">Windows 11</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/">MacOS Monterey</a>. Three companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft) and three platforms (smartphone, tablets, desktop/laptop).</p>
<p>I installed iPadOS Version 15 on my iPad Mini yesterday and I haven&rsquo;t spent a significant enough time with it yet. So far it&rsquo;s a mixed bag. For example, being able to place widgets on the home screen makes them a bunch more useful, but the tradeoff is a decrease in the number of icons per line that display. My old iPad Mini has a quarter inch bezel followed by a half inch of empty space on the left and right side of the screen. I fear this is going to look worse on the iPad Air.</p>
<p>Of course, iPhone owners have had widgets and App Library since last year, so this is not new to them. I don&rsquo;t own an iPhone, but so far I wonder whether they see much new in this version of iOS.</p>
<p>For some reason I like how the App Library flys up from the lower right of the screen. I do think App Library is a better way to manage applications than has existed prior, just wish I could edit what Apple does automatically to tailor the result. I suspect the larger icons in each group were determined to be the most frequently used app of that group, do they change over time?</p>
<p>The changes of widgets and App Library create questions of what icons to place on the home screen if any, given the dock. Tapping the widgets launches the associated app, so they serve that purpose in addition to providing information. I probably don&rsquo;t need any icons but so far I have kept six: Mail, Safari, Streaks, Notes, NetNewsWire and Pocket. Another decision is, what to do with the &ldquo;old page&rdquo; that displays when you swipe right from the left edge? The widgets on the home screen don&rsquo;t need to also be there, so there is some changes to be made.</p>
<p>What else? I know the changes to how multitasking works is significant, but I won&rsquo;t fully experience that until I upgrade the iPad Air. This is the fun of operating system season, discovering new &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; and hoping they aren&rsquo;t lumps of coal.</p>

			 <p>British inventor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clive-sinclair-dead-obituary-212309487.html?src=rss&amp;utm_source=pocket_mylist">Sir Clive Sinclair died yesterday, September 16</a>. I, of course, never met this man who had an impact on the direction of my life.</p>
<p>My chosen field of study in college, computer science, led to the career that caused me to move to metropolitan Detroit, ultimately meet and marry my wife, and have the life I now live. How I came to chose to study computer science was influenced by three events during my high school years: the arrival of the Apple II in my high school, taking an after school BASIC programming class, and being gifted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000">the Timex Sinclair 1000</a>. Sir Sinclair invented the ZX80, the predecessor to the ZX8, in Britian, and that same computer was later sold as the Timex Sinclair 1000 in the United States.</p>
<p>I was raised by my grandmother and we lived off social security along with some savings. The personal computers sold at the time cost well beyond our means, but the Timex Sinclair only cost $100, though you needed the nearly $40 additional cost of the 16 KB storage for it to be useful. The nearly $150 total cost made it the most expensive gift my grandmother ever bought me, and I don&rsquo;t doubt she made sacrifices to buy it, but she felt it important for my future. Turns out my grandmother was right.</p>
<p>Even by the standards of the time, the Timex Sinclair was a bit of a joke for a computer. Frogger was one of the games available for the Timex Sinclair that my friend called &ldquo;woodtick&rdquo; because of how the large block pixel graphics of the frog took over the entire TV screen when it got run over by a car.</p>
<p>Back then the common display for personal computers were TV screens. Programs were stored on cassete tapes. As I said, the Timex Sinclair only had 16 kilobytes of RAM. It had a membrane keyboard rather than a real keyboard that had most of the BASIC functions assigned. When writing a program you &ldquo;typed&rdquo; PRINT by pressing a combination of a function key and they key that had the command printed on it. I don&rsquo;t recall whether I ever connected the Timex Sinclair to a printer or did anything like word processing.</p>
<p>Despite the limits Sinclair&rsquo;s invention made a brand new world of personal computing accessible to me in the comfort of my bedroom floor. Hours of typing in pre-printed programs from magazines and hours of experimenting with little BASIC programs sparked the interest that as I said led to the life I now have.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/17/clive-sinclair-zx-spectrum-offbeat-brilliance?utm_source=pocket_mylist">tributes and stories</a> of Sinclair, I know that I am just one of hundreds of thousands of people around the world that share the same story. What a wonderful legacy. Thank you Sir Sinclair, rest in peace.</p>

			 <p>Twenty years ago today, a Sikh father was murdered in front of his gas station in Mesa, Arizona by a man who called himself a patriot. Balbir Singh Sodhi was the first person killed in thousands of acts of hate in the aftermath of 9/11. Since his murder, countless lives have been lost or shattered by the way our nation responded to 9/11 — in decades of war, torture, surveillance, deportations, detentions, and hate violence that continues today.</p>
<p>Balbir Singh Sodhi was a kind-hearted and generous man, whom many called “Uncle.” He would give candy to children who came to his gas station as if they were his own children. He let people who didn’t have money for gas fill up and go. His brothers would shake their heads in disbelief. Was he a saint or a fool? But Balbir Uncle would just smile, saying God wants us to serve all. He and his brothers had come to America to escape religious persecution against Sikhs in India. He was planting flowers in front of his gas station when he was shot in the back, targeted for his turban.</p>
<p>Balbir Uncle wore his turban as part of his faith — his commitment to love all of humanity. What if we made the vision that he died for our North Star? What would the world look like if we valued human dignity above all? What if we chose, like Balbir Uncle, to treat all as family, to see no stranger? How would we be remembered 20 years from now? #BalbirSodhi #20YearsSince</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve listened to <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/michael-wolff-on-the-trump-threat">Andrew Sullivan&rsquo;s interview with Michael Wolff</a>, who has written three books about the Trump presidency. Wolff&rsquo;s assessment of Trump is straightforward, he believes Trump is crazy and thus not competent to be a real threat to Democracy. I think Wolff is being too myopic in his assessment, a Trump presidency is not the same as Trump the man. Trump the man is a mark for those in power and that makes a Trump presidency dangerous. Another Trump presidency is dangerous for how it will be used by those who Trump thinks is an ally.</p>

			 <p>In my feeds this morning are some statements recalling how united they thought we were on 9/12/2001 and wishing that was the same today. A deeper, perhaps more meaningful question might be, why is it that the United States can only unite around hatred for an external enemy?</p>
<p>Some thought, many hoped, back then that the event would be a catalyst for change. Of course change is always happening, transformation is what is really desired. The difference is between what naturally happens and intent. Transformation requires true understanding of from what to what, which in turn requires a desire to look within.</p>
<p>Take for example the pandemic. Much of the struggle amongst ourselves is superficial. Wear a mask, don&rsquo;t wear a mask. Get the vaccine, I&rsquo;ll never get the vaccine. Our attention is on these arguments with little thought about why the arguments are even happening.</p>
<p>For me what the pandemic exposes, and what has existed from well before 9/11, is a majority of people stuck within the basic animal instinct to view everything and everyone by comparison. Either you&rsquo;re or with me or you&rsquo;re against me is one of our most basic survival instincts. While this instinct keeps us alive in a moment of crisis, living constantly in this mode prevents one from growing and usually makes us vulnerable to being manipulated in to decisions not in our long term best interests.</p>
<p>The transformation some of us desired after 9/11 that would have resulted in more unity did not happen because there was no intention for it to happen. Change, yes, that has happened, we have evolved to a more fractured not united state than before, and will apparently continue to do so unless we intentionally chose a different path.</p>
<p>The United States of America is only 245 years old. In comparison to the world, the U.S. is a toddler, to the universe, an infant. Our growth (transformation) relies in embracing the seemingly conflicting values of liberty and unity, by transformation from an either/or worldview to a both/and worldview. The transformation will not be easy because everything we know and see around us is built on and reinforces either/or. Either/or keeps power in power. <a href="https://youtu.be/zE7PKRjrid4">Take the red pill</a></p>

Ever since they were enacted we have been stuck in a war over the New Deal laws and philosophy that put constraints the capitalist/wealthy class of the United States. Underlying all of that is the class warfare that drove the finding of the New World and is implicit in the founding of the United States.  We won&rsquo;t achieve anything that we want until we become honest about our beginnings.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Yet it is the peculiar genius of our society that its rulers have figured out a way, as in the case of the fish-fryers, to ensure that rage is directed precisely against those who actually do get to do meaningful work. For instance: in our society, there seems a general rule that, the more obviously one&rsquo;s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781444791709">In the Shelter: Finding a Home in the World</a> by Pádraig Ó Tuama 📚</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book because it contains so much wisdom scavenged during life lived. Chapter 8, Hello To Change, is particularly good with the following standing out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many, the possibility of being wrong is a threat to the foundations of thought, morality, or empire. And without a doubt, those who advocate scientific thought are as prone as other schools of thought to being superior. But written into the heart of science is the embrace of the gift of being wrong.&rdquo; page 197 (I would add, due to my current political mindset, that in a similar way written into the heart of democracy is the embrace of the possibility of losing an election. I see a common denominator between the emergent anti-science and anti-democracy ideaologies.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Greek word translated into English as “repentance” is metanoia. The prefix meta means “beyond,” hence metaphysics being the study of—or speculation about—what is beyond the natural. The word noia means “thought” or “mind.” Together, however, metanoia means to change your thoughts, to change your mind, to turn in a new direction, to reverse a direction and go a different way&rdquo; page 198</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Technically, then, this should mean that the Christian faith is a faith that is adapted to change, a faith that is not undone by realizing that its precepts or propositions are incorrect.</strong>&rdquo; page 198, empahsis mine.</p>

			 <p>A little over a week ago I installed <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes">beta 4</a> of Android 12 on my Google Pixel 4a. I have not experienced any significant issues with running this version of Android, even though it is still a true beta and not a release candidate.</p>
<p>Like most men, I imagine, I carry my phone in my front pants pocket. In the past I occasionally discovered that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-on-flashlight-on-android">the flashlight feature</a> of the phone turned on while the phone is in my pocket, causing an odd, if not humorous, appearance. After installing Android 12 I found this occurring much too frequently.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7443425?hl=en">Two lock screen settings</a> appear to be the culprits: Tap to check phone and lift to check phone. Movement while walking is being interpreted by Android as either a tap or a lift, so I have disabled both features. I notice that Android seems to be smart enough to know the phone is in my pocket because it turns off the ambient display, so it should also disable the tap and lift to check functions, and I have provided feedback on this to Google.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/689828/how-to-disable-or-enable-app-suggestions-on-a-pixel/">App suggestions</a>, which many people do not like and probably disable, are not working. Google added this feature in Android 11 that changes which app icons appear in the dock at the bottom of the home screen and at the top of the app drawer with the ones most commonly used at a particular time of day. Right now the icons displaying are the ones that were present in the dock at the time I installed the upgrade and have never been changed by Android. I might be the only person who likes this feature enough to report it not working.</p>
<p>I like the changes to the UI that Google has made, particularly increasing the font size in settings. The changes to the notifications are nice, although I am not sure whether I am a fan of the increased size of the Quick Settings icons, I think I wish they were the same as in Android 11.</p>
<p>Of course, the big change in Android 12 is the new design language called <a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you">Material You</a> with includes automatically changing the overall color appearance to the wallpaper on the phone. I have the Landscapes wallpaper changing daily to see changes with the appearance of the phone, and I am pretty pleased with what I am seeing.</p>
<p>I have not noticed any significant difference with over all performance or battery life, which is good. Ideally we would get better battery life in each release, but at the least we don&rsquo;t want to lose battery life.
Beta 4 marks Android 12 reaching the platform stability phase, which marks it as feature and API complete so that developers can test against a reliable version. One more release, release candidate one, will be made available before the final release of Android 12.</p>
<p>Android 11 was released on September 8, 2020, if Google is to meet that same early September release date we should see the release candidate late next week, which might coincide with the launch of the Pixel 5a.</p>

			 <p>It seems to happen over and over again. I read about a <a href="https://glass.photo/">new app</a>, so I click the link (assuming the author of whatever I am reading provides a link) and usually see two things that turn me off. First, the app only runs on one platform, often iOS or MacOS. Next the app has some type of subscription fee. Both are significant constraints, either I can&rsquo;t run the app or I can&rsquo;t afford to pay for the app.</p>
<p>The subscription pricing model is the most out of control. No more pay once for a version that you can use as long as one wished. Worse, are monthly subscriptions that add up to paying $100 or more per year. I get the allure for the sellers but how much in total money do these developers think people are willing to pay?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Google Wear OS is a hot mess. During Google I/O earlier this year I got the impression that due to the partnership between Google and Samsung the pending Galaxy Watch 4 would be more in line with standard Wear OS watches. Given that it appears the Samsung watches will be the only ones to get Wear OS 3 this year, I was considering buying one.</p>
<p>However, as I read more reviews about the Galaxy watches I am becoming less likely to buy one. <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-is-missing-this-killer-feature-at-launch">First I read</a> that Google Assistant is not preinstalled. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/galaxy-watch-4-pairing-process-wear-os/">Next I read</a> that the watches don&rsquo;t easily pair with non-Samsung phones, nor work the the Android Wear OS app.</p>
<p>Amazingly, it looks like there will not be a serious Wear OS watch to buy in 2021, and there wasn&rsquo;t one last year. It feels like Google has or should just give up. As the Fossil Sport I have been wearing is getting more finicky, I am contemplating my next step. Buy a <a href="https://www.mobvoi.com/us/pages/ticwatche3">Mobvoi</a> that is expected to be the first to get Wear OS 3 next year, or dump Wear OS altogether and buy a Fitbit?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse are suggestions that Wear OS 3 may not work best on the Qualcomm 4100 chip in the Mobvoi, the chip that is the next generation smart watch chip from Qualcomm. What the heck?</p>
<p>Hot mess indeed</p>

			 <p>Yesterday Google released the final user beta for Android 12, and as I did since version 10, I have installed it on my <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/pixel-4a">Pixel 4a</a>. First thing I looked for is how the new UI colors and fonts look and I found that to really see that you need to be in light mode rather than dark mode. I&rsquo;ve been using dark mode full time with <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/android-11">Android 11</a>.</p>
<p>I did the update late last night so one of the new features I experienced first is the update to the ambient display, the larger clock display is handy at night when I wake up and want to see the time.</p>
<p>I think I like the changes to the notification shade but the larger quick setting buttons look off. Everything in the UI seems larger, which I appreciate.</p>
<p>One other change I looked forward to is the use of the power button to activate Google Assistant, which you have to specifically configure in settings. I disable &ldquo;Hey Google&rdquo; mostly to save battery life, but also because I find I don&rsquo;t use it very much. Wish Google would add a gesture to the fingerprint scanner in which if I press and hold the phone would unlock and activate Assistant. If I just tap the scanner the unlock the phone, if I keep my finger in the scanner then unlock and activate assistant.</p>

			 <p>The summer Olympic are nearly done and I really didn’t watch it much. I think a big part of the problem was the time difference and the Internet providing the results. What I will remember from these Olympics, however, is how dangerous is gymnastics. Too much was written about Simone Biles’ “mental health” in a way suggesting what she was experiencing was “just” emotions. The problem was much more dire, the alignment of brain and body so that she lands on her feet and not her head.</p>
<p>Humans are not cats. Search for why cats land on their feet. If you ever had vertigo or just got dizzy, imagine that disorientation while spinning upside down ten feet in the air.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/05.html#a125406">Dave Winer is contemplating</a> how to support tools for thought on small screen devices like smartphones.</p>
<p>The lesson learned since Personal Digital Assistants and later smartphones first appeared is that screen size matters. Small screen, defined as less than seven inches,
use case is different from large screen size, a fact that Microsoft was unwilling to embrace.</p>
<p>For me, tools for thought on small screens should be optimized for the following use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data capture via the Operating System&rsquo;s sharing functionality so that I can easily and quickly capture information from other applications. One of the main reasons why I continue using Evernote is that it supports capturing information via mobile OS sharing functions and browser web clipping.</li>
<li>Fast and easy search to retrieve information that I store in my tools for thought. Again, I find Evernote does a good job here not only by an included search function but also via shortcuts that enable me to quickly retrieve information.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t often write on my smartphone. If the tool supports the OS sharing functionality then any app could be used for input and then sent in to the tool for thought, which is the model that Drafts is optimized for on iOS. If the app is for writing then a blank page is easiest for input, any type of outlining structure is difficult to manage on a small screen.</li>
</ul>

I&rsquo;ve not had a single performance issue with the $349 Pixel 4a that I am currently using.</p>
<p>The big question Google is facing is, does the smartphone market have room for a third luxury, high priced, smartphone? Seems to me that people who buy for status buy iPhones or Samsung and I am not convinced they are going to choose Pixel 6 over either.</p>

The bad news is that the Delta variant is more contagious.</p>
<p>We need to change the focus on COVID from death rates to other measures that show the impact of the continuing spread. COVID still can have significant impacts even when ti doesn&rsquo;t kill you, and we need to put the focus on that. Too many still think COVID is nothing more than a cold, or at worst case the flu.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve observed this before and I will write it again, the <a href="https://www.oakgov.com/covid/dashboard.html">trend of COVID cases in my county</a> right now looks nearly identical to the trend last year at this time. We have the vaccine right now but we also are outdoors more. My expectation is that due to the Delta variant and the vaccination rate, the trend will look nearly the same for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>And here is what to worry about&hellip; what will the variant after Delta be like?</p>

			 <p>Dave has <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/28.html#a144850">a feature on Scripting News</a> that he calls tagging, which is basically a reference to all the writing on his site that includes that tag. It&rsquo;s a similar concept to how Roam, Logseq, and Obsidian use what I call wiki links that not only link to an internal page but also show all places where that page is referenced.</p>
<p>The problem for me is that Dave is using an editing construct in a published form. In my opinion in a published HTML page, a hyperlink is a hyperlink is a hyperlink. Wiki does have the concept of providing an indicator to show a hyperlink is to an external site.</p>
<p>The problem is I find these additional &ldquo;indicators' intrusive to reading the page. The underline commonly associated to hyperlinks on web pages is the least intrusive to my reading content.</p>
<p>If it were me, I would  keep the appearance of the linsk the same in the HTML, but I would open external links to a new browser tab or page while keeping internal links on the page one is in, if it is even important to the reader to understand the difference between an internal and external link.</p>

<p>Rather than a Platonic, matter and spirit (body and soul) metaphysics, Caputo says the distinction is between two types of time. Conditional time, or time spent doing this to achieve/obtain that, and unconditional time, times when something comes over us that is savored for itself. As metaphor, Caputo uses the rose, which is without why, it blossoms because it blossoms, it cares not for itself and not if it&rsquo;s seen.</p>

			 <p>What made local area and wireless networks happen are industry standards that enable different vendor products to work with each other. The Internet Of Things is nearly the exact opposite, in my home is a case in point. I have Hue lights that require a Hue hub for management and I have a number of sensors and smart switches that use Zigbee that I manage with Samsung&rsquo;s SmartThings hub.</p>
<p>The SmartThings hub can control the Hue lights, but the Hue hub only knows Hue products. I started first with the Hue lights and the hub, but if I had could have seen in the future I might have just bought the SmartThings hub. On the other hand, one big thing I get with the Hue hub is the use of a catalog of scenes that combine different colors to make for some pretty nice lighting in our basement.</p>
<p>I recently bought two cheaper Sylvania color smartlights when recent heavy rains suggested it might be nice to have a color smartlight in our living room, right now we have a non-color Hue light in the living room. We have a moisture sensor in the sump pump pit that works with the SmartThings hub and an automation in SmartThings that turns on all of the lights when moisture is detected. The automation sets the color lights to purple (homage to Prince) but obviously cannot do that with non-color lights. It happened the automation was recently triggered during the evening when the living room light might normally come on so I realize it just turning on might not be enough notification. Thus the idea to buy a color light, thus the purpose of the Sylvania light because the Hue light costs $50.</p>
<p>Before putting the new Sylvania light in the living room I decided to test it in the basement, where I have the color Hue lights, and here exposes the problem. The Hue lights are controlled by the Hue hub that knows nothing about the Sylvania light, this the Sylvania light cannot be part of the any of the Hue scenes. Perhaps I can find a &ldquo;third party&rdquo; app that works with SmartThings to replace Hue scenes, but I have not yet done the research.</p>
<p>Better, yet, would be an industry standard for controlling these color lights that would enable me to fully control them, with scenes, from one hub or &ldquo;smart device.&rdquo; Of course, this is a known problem and industy leaders appear to be working together to address it by developing <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/">a protocol called Matter</a>. Hopefully, there will be a day when all I need is one controlling device, technically right now I have three: Hue hub, SmartThings hub, Amazon Echo, and Google Home.</p>
<p>P.S. I really hope the Matter protocol addresses how smartlights handle resumption of power after a power outage. Hue added the ability to enforce the last known state, if a light was off when the power went off then it is supposed to stay off when power is restored. However, I&rsquo;ve found that doesn&rsquo;t work well with multiple successive short power loses. Worse, is the fact that the Sylvania light appears to not have such a setting. When power is restored the light turns on, regardless of its prior state.</p>

			 <p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much to figure out why the Chicago Cubs have faded and are out of the running for the playoffs. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats/team">Team batting average</a> is nearly dead last, ranked 28 of 30 teams. On base percentage is ranked 23, and slug is ranked 19. I am surprised that Cubs pitching is as good as it is, their team ERA of 4.10 puts them in the top 10, although their WHIP of 1.32 ranks them 18th in the league. (WHIP might be a better indicator than ERA.)</p>
<p>Bottom line is that the Chicago Cubs lineup is not very good. If you are another team looking to pick up a bat to help you make the playoffs, given the stats, beyond Kris Bryant, which other batters would you trade for to help your lineup?</p>

<p>I had nodestorage configured to publish the content to a S3 bucket, which is serving it directly, so I was not expecting the outage to affect the published site, but it does. When you first access the top navigation bar is delayed in loading. Looking at the page source I see variables that contain URLS back to that old site, one which appears to be defining a chat log socket. Unfortunately, this means to not have this affect on the old blog content I need to keep nodestorage running at the URL provided.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen two <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/google-play-wear-os-apps-for-watches-finally-easier-to-find-19683005/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">articles today reporting</a> that Google has updated the Play Store on Android Smartphones so that it can remotely (directly) install Wear OS apps on the watch. One of my main complaints about Wear OS is that it requires me to install/manage apps directly on the watch, which is too difficult given the small screen. In the beginning Google enabled one to install/manage their watches from the phone and they took that away in favor of a standalone app store on the watch, a move that made no sense to me at the time even if that is something done on the Apple Watch.</p>
<p>So far I have not seen this update appear on my Pixel 4a. While I can see the Wear OS category in the Play Store, it still really is a list of Android smartphone apps that have Wear OS components, meaning if you have to first install the app on the phone and then go in to the Play Store on the watch to install the associated Wear OS app, which is a totally braindead approach!</p>

			 <p><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/18.html#a183936">Dave</a>, in the context of the Internet, the garden and the stream are metaphors for two different approaches to content on the Internet. A stream is ephemeral, it continues to move over time and one mostly adds to it and watches it flow away. On the Internet a stream is content for only right now, and usually isn&rsquo;t edited nor looked at years later. Streams are date and time driven. Stream platforms are optimized for quick and easy entry of new content.</p>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, and blogs are examples of platforms used for publishing streams of content. Note that this is not absolute, for example one can and might edit a blog post they wrote a year ago in which case that blog might well be a garden.</p>
<p>The garden metaphor, in contrast, is more permanent. The content in a garden is continually edited to reflect new ideas or new learning over a period of time. A garden is organized around a topic. Platforms for creating and maintaining gardens are optimized for editing and linking together of content. Connecting the dots (linking) between content can generate new ideas or thoughts. Wiki is an example of a garden platform, as is the web itself as originally intended, as are other tools optimized for linking together and organizing content.</p>
<p>A couple of other interesting differences exist between the two from a user and platform provider perspective. Almost all streams are public, their very point is public sharing, and the platform providers freely provide their platforms and make their money my manipulating the presentation of what one puts in to the stream to others. Users have little to no control over who sees what they put in to the stream.</p>
<p>Gardens are either public or private, thus users tend to have more control over who and how one sees their content. Platform providers either freely provide their platform as open source for users to install in their own computers or they make money by hosting their platforms and charging uses for renting space on their hosting. The key point being the garden platform providers do not make money on the content. In my opinion, a site that has the purpose of making money from content is something other than a garden, so for example, I do not think of Medium as a garden, nor are other sites like The Verge or Engadget that may publish using a blogging or content management system.</p>

			 <p>This site is now back to full functionality, meaning the Photos and Archive pages full render. As part of the troubleshooting I changed the appearance of the site. When I look at the site using a desktop PC browser I am not pleased by the amount of white space on the left and right sides, nor do I like the navigation options a the top being right-justified. On the other hand, the site looks really nice on a smaller screen, and chances are if anyone does read this site they read it using a phone or tablet. So I think I will keep the appearance for now rather than revert to the prior layout. However, I reserve the right to try some of the other themes that are available to me.</p>

In the United States freedom is secured by a representative government through which the governed provide their consent by voting.

<p>Summer not only means warm weather, it also means a new version of Android is evolving toward a fall release. As Leo Laporte has said, we reached peak smartphone several years ago, therefore each release seems to be just new makeup. New makeup sells, but does nothing to actuality change that which it covers.</p>
<p>Rumors are that the next major Google Pixel phone will use Google&rsquo;s design of an ARM chip, so they can &ldquo;me-too&rdquo; with Apple and Microsoft. Will the new version of Android do anything that makes Google&rsquo;s chip design stand out?</p>

It seems every new release I read, &ldquo;this iPad is ridiculously fast and not designed for current applications but rather for future applications,&rdquo; and yet do we ever see those future applications? Yet now many spend more than $1K on a fully loaded iPad.</p>
<p>I just want iPadOS to properly use external monitors by supporting extended displays and full resolutions.</p>

		<a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/05/15/seeking-usbc-dock.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-05-15 11:15:00 -0400">May 15, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> USB-C Docks that include USB 3 data ports most likely do not support DisplayPort 4K at 60 Hz unless they support DisplayPort 1.4. A dock with a DisplayPort port and USB 2.1 probably can do 4K@60Hz.</p>
<p>I recently bought a <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html">BenQ 4K monitor</a> and when I connected it to the USB-C dock that I had I found out that the dock could only support 4K at 30HZ, which is noticeably slow just when moving the mouse on the screen. Just about all the computer monitors we use support 60 Hz refresh rates.</p>
<p>Now, I was using my Pixelbook with the dock and I found that when I connect it to the monitor using a USB-C cable it can do 4K@60Hz, so I figured the dock was the limiting factor, which I confirmed on the manufacture&rsquo;s web site. I then started to search for docks that say they can do 4K@60Hz and decided on the <a href="https://us.anker.com/products/a8392">Anker PowerExpander</a>.</p>
<p>As you probably imagine by now, I got the new dock yesterday and found it also is only doing 4K@30Hz, on the HDMI and DisplayPorts. Sigh. I tested the dock with another computer and it does 4K@60Hz, so I am back looking at the Pixelbook.</p>
<p>I have since learned from <a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/2019/05/19/explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub/">this article</a> that the problem is that USB-C docks need to support data transfer as well as display and that decreases the number of lanes that are available for display at high refresh rates to two, whereas 4K@60Hz needs all four lanes. When you connect the Pixelbook to a monitor with a USB-C cable it can use all four of the cable&rsquo;s communication lanes to enable it to handle 4K@60Hz.</p>
<p>Anker&rsquo;s site says 4K on DisplayPort requires DisplayPort 1.4 and I have found that the Pixelbook only supports DisplayPort 1.2. As the article I found explains, DisplayPort 1.4 only needs two lanes for 4K@60Hz because it has an additional high bit rate mode and compression, which is why the Anker hub I have can do 4K@60Hz while also providing USB 3.1 data transfers. The problem is that the computer, hub, and monitor all need to support DisplayPort 1.4 for this all to work, and the Pixelbook does not.</p>
<p>The lesson from this experience is that connecting to high resolution monitors at high refresh rates via a hub is more complicated than simply using a cable because it requires understanding the technical capabilities of the computer, hub, and monitor. You may have to dig to find out whether a computer, and a Chromebook in particular, supports DisplayPort 1.4. Thunderbolt 3 also supports 4K@60Hz and fast data transfers but is not yet available in Chromebooks and Thunderbolt 3 docks are more expensive than USB-C docks.</p>
<p>I think my experience that I&rsquo;ve written about here explains why <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/chromebook-docking-stations/">Google recently announced</a> the addition of docks to their &ldquo;Works With Chromebook&rdquo; program. If Google were to announced a new Pixelbook this summer that had DisplayPort 1.4 support (or Thunderbolt 3) it would be helpful to know exactly which Docks can do 4K@60Hz.</p>
<p>As for my current situation, even though this new Anker dock cannot provide 4K@60Hz with my Pixelbook, it has more display ports to drive multiple monitors and has more data ports than the hub it replaced, so I still have an upgrade over the dock I was using previously. However, had I known what I now know prior to purchasing this Anker dock, I probably would have bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B06Y5N3YCD/?tag=runworks-20">this Cable Matters dock</a> instead as I could live with USB 2.1. For now I using the slightly lower 2560 x 1600 resolution at 60Hz rather than 4K, but if I really want 4K I can connect directly to the monitor via one USB-C port and use the dock on the other for power and the additional ports.</p>

<p>In Michigan, if you are fully vaccinated, you are not required to wear a mask. How does a restaurant or store know whether or not a person is fully vaccinated? Most likely people will just stop wearing masks and those who opt to wear them will become stigmatized.</p>
<p>And we are not yet at 50% of people fully vaccinated. We may be ok for the summer, but when the cold weather hits and people start congregating in poorly ventilated indoor locations, there will be outbreaks, and then, what will happen?</p>
<p>Keep in mind, mask wearing is never really been about personal protection against infection, it&rsquo;s been about preventing spread by people who do not yet know they are infected from spreading it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/05/12/i-am-following.html">A Wiki User&#39;s Expectation Of Double Square Brackets</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/05/12/i-am-following.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-05-12 12:00:00 -0400">May 12, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am following <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/12.html#a142449">Dave&rsquo;s writing</a> about the integration of <a href="http://littleoutliner.com">Little Outliner</a> with apps like Obsidian and Logseq. I think it&rsquo;s important to note that neither Obsidian nor Logseq are outliners, they are markdown editors with outlining and wiki features. I would characterize Little Oultiner as an outline editor that could have other features like wiki and markdown.</p>
<p>How Obsidian handles text between doulbe brackets is an example of a feature it incorporates from wikis. There is an existing standard for using double brackets, it is an <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links">internal wiki link</a> and the expected action is that it automatically links to a page that exists within the app hosting and editing the content. Usually what is between the double square brackets is the name of the page. If the page already exists, clicking the link loads that page in the app. If the page does not already exist, clicking the link creates a new page with that title in which one can then edit.</p>
<p>The key is that an internal link is generated and managed by the editing app not the user, where as an external link is provided and managed by the user of the app. As an example, I edit <a href="http://frankm.info">my now page</a> in Little Outliner that I think is currently served by an instance of PagePark. (Click <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/?url=http://instantoutliner.com/i9">here</a> to see the outline in Little Outliner) On that page the fourth note has a link to <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">tech.frankm.info</a> that is another outline I edit in Little Outliner. I created the link between the two using the linking tool in Little Outliner, but what if I had put double brackets around the words Technology That I Use in that sentence?</p>
<p>Based on my experience with <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">wiki</a>, Obsidian, and Roam, I expect that when a double bracket is put around those words Little Outliner creates a link to an outline (a page if you will in Little Outliner) with the name &ldquo;Technology That I Use.&rdquo; If I click that link in Little Outliner it opens the page in Little Outliner (could be a tab) and displays the contents of the page, or a blank page if it is new.</p>
<p>To complete the thought, from a publishing perspective, PagePark could follow the internal link to the OPML file and render it as it does today, with the net result of more easily writing and publishing a multi-page site edited by Little Outliner and served by PagePark.</p>
<p>Long time users of Little Outliner may recall <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/05/15/watchthis.html#4">the glossary function</a> that automatically substitutes text between double quotes to corresponding text in a separate file. One way you can think of it is like a text expander where you can put a commonly used abbreviation in quotes and when the outline is rendered the associated text in the glossary file is subsituted.</p>
<p>For example, if you look at the second bullet under Notes in <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/?url=http://instantoutliner.com/i9">my status outline</a> you see that &ldquo;my blog&rdquo; and &ldquo;my Twitter feed&rdquo; are in quotes and on <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml#1586545154000">the published page</a> you see them as hyperlinks because I have the HTML for the hyperlinks in my glossary file, which is specified by the urGlossary value in the OPML head of the file. When I was publishing <a href="http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/">my blog using Fargo.io</a>, (and prior iterations of Dave&rsquo;s blogging platforms) the glossary was one of my favorite time saving features.</p>

<p>The Wilmington coup stands as the only successful and lasting armed overthrow of a legitimate municipal government in American history on U.S soil.

Not only was it a stain upon North Carolina, but on the federal government, too, which knowingly abandoned Black people to death and destruction.</p>

			 <p>I tried Tile tags and stopped using them, because I found I don’t lose things, so I am wondering whether the people caught up in the Air Tags hysteria really need them, or just craving a new Apple thing? What I most wanted the Tile to do is not let me forget my pills. I put a tag on a pill box, but found that the notification that my phone and the tag were apart came way too late.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently discovered <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moleskine-journey/id1489704689#?platform=ipad">Moleskine Journey</a>, which is a personal information manager designed for creative minds, independent workers, audacious backpackers, and free spirits, Moleskine Journey uniquely combines the best features from productivity applications, like calendars, reminders, and notes, with tools for personal development, such as diaries and habit tracking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id989178902?mt=8">Moleskine Timepage</a>, which I like because has a different take on how calendar apps look and work. Journey&rsquo;s focus on more personal aspects of daily tracking rather than calendar and tasks is appealing. Better yet, the app is also available on Android and the Web.</p>

			 <p>For me the most frustrating and disappointing thing about reactions to COVID is that so many people only think about it in terms of personal health and not public health. I may be at lower risk of severe symptoms but I can carry the disease to someone who is at high risk. The possibility that I could do something that results in the death of another obligates me to take the situation seriously.</p>
<p>Another problem that people don&rsquo;t seem to grasp is that longer the virus out of control the more mutations that will occur, which has consequences to all of us. It is likely the recent surge in Michigan is due to a mutation.</p>

			 <p>Forgive my moment of patting myself on the back. Last night I found that the fill valve in the toilet on the main floor of our house needed to be replaced. I am not experienced with home repairs and in the past managed to mangle toilet repair enough to call in a professional to fix the job. So, in normal circumstances I would have just scheduled a plumber to repair, but I decided to search for information, found videos on YouTube that showed me what to do, and today I bought the parts and made the replacement as easily as was shown in the video.</p>

The PC has two USB ports, one USB 3 port on the left side and what I think is a USB 2 port on the right. In the left port is a dongle for my Jabra wireless headset, and in the right port I have a Logitech Unifying receiver for the keyboard and mouse. I have frustrating experiences with mouse that appears to be due to it frequently losing connectivity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve swapped the two devices between ports and that fixes the mouse issue, but then the headset loses connectivity, so I think that means there is some type of interference with the right USB port.</p>
<p>I have a USB-C hub and a there is a USB-C port with the computer, so I plugged in the hub and plugged the Logitech receiver to the hub but that didn&rsquo;t fix the problem. I am now using an USB extension cable and the Logitech receiver plugged in to it. I don&rsquo;t know why the hub didn&rsquo;t work, it should have.</p>

<p>I think another reason why Republicans are not willing to change is that they have not yet faced reality that they are a minority. Their arguments for why the 2020 presidential election was &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; can only hold if they think there is more of them than others. In other words, if Republicans are a minority then by definition they will get less votes, and we have seen this played out by the fact that since 1988 they have lost the popular vote for all but one presidential election.</p>

			 <p>The Chicago Cubs is <a href="https://nitter.42l.fr/JesseRogersESPN/status/1381802102150864897#m">the worst hitting team in baseball</a>, but this shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise. It seems obvious to me that the Cubs' front office does not properly evaluate hitting talent, every player on their team is a home run hitter. When Schwarber left they went and got a literal hitting duplicate, Joc Pederson, as a replacement. Nico Horner was the best hitter in spring training and they sent him back to the minors in favor of another home run hitter.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t blame the manager, and I can&rsquo;t really blame the players, they are who they area. The problem rests entirely with the front office. Really, one hit wonders. How lucky we were in 2016!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently started using a 32-inch monitor, and I am figuring out its best ergonomic setup. I&rsquo;ve searched for information, and <a href="http://www.healthycomputing.com/office/setup/monitor/index.html">this article</a> is one of the few that I&rsquo;ve found that make a specific recommendation for large monitors. When I ordered the monitor, which is <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html">a BenQ 32-inch</a>, I was concerned by the fact that the height was not adjustable and it would be too low, but that has proven to not be an issue. If anything the monitor might be a tad too high.</p>
<p>According to the ergonomic recommendations, the top of the monitor should be at eye level. In my case the top bevel of the monitor is a couple of inches above my eye level. I could raise my chair to move my eye level up, but then my feet don&rsquo;t comfortably touch the floor and I felt it in my legs.</p>
<p>On the other hand with the larger screen I am now viewing content in separate windows rather than full screen. Consequently I can move the windows in which content is displayed to where it is most comfortable, and so there is a gap in the display at the top that I will never really look at.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve installed the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/">Windows 10 PowerToys</a> so that I can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones">FancyZones</a> windows manager to create layouts for placing windows on the screen. My current configuration has one large window occupying about 65% of the left side where I display the primary 1580 x 1356 window I am viewing. The remaining screen space on the right is split in half, with a top 792 x 661 and bottom 792 x 653 windows for MS Teams and Outlook.  The smaller windows are for glancing at information, either chats, calendar, or my inbox. When I process my inbox in Outlook I move Outlook to the larger window on the left of the screen.</p>
<p>To complete the picture, I also us two virtual desktops, the primary one I described above, the secondary one I have OneNote in the large window, Microsoft Todo, and File Manager in the two smaller windows.</p>

People need to understand that the faster the rate of infection the higher the percentage of full vaccination needed to affect the spread.  In short, thinking that because people can now get vaccines one can revert to pre-COVID behavior is increasing how much longer we are dealing with this and the continued risks of more mutations.</p>

			 <p>Brent Simmons has written <a href="https://inessential.com/2021/04/06/im_still_living_with_the_longterm_effects_of_a_disease_that_now_has_a_vaccine">a blog post</a> that does a good job of explaining my greatest fear about COVID. It&rsquo;s not just about whether or not I might die if I got the disease, it&rsquo;s how much it might ruin my health, forever, if I got the disease.</p>
<p>I think far too many people are just looking at the death rates and thinking COVID is no worse than the flu or pneumonia, which have their risks but low probability of resulting in death without pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>The problem with those comparisons is that we know much more about those illnesses than we know about COVID. The unknown consequences increase risk to everyone because we know of people who are otherwise in good health becoming seriously ill and even dying.</p>

			 <p>I read <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-the-west-lost-covid-19.html">this long piece</a> about how western countries have struggled to respond to COVID, which resulted in a tremendous loss of life. To me, it boils down to one issue, politics. It seems that in western countries led by elected leaders, decisions and lack of decisions were due to the calculus of political consequences. For example, the Trump administration&rsquo;s slow response was due to all decisions made in terms of whether they help or hinder their ability to be re-elected. In the east there were no worries about election consequences, so there was probably little debate over whether to move fast or be alarmist.</p>
<p>In the United States we seemed to have lost the idea that there should be non-partisans in government positions so they focus entirely on the public interest and not on their political ambitions. The transition is most obvious in what has happened to the Supreme Court, which unlike the intent of the Founders, has in practice become partisan.</p>

			 <p>I set up a new <a href="https://tv.google/">Google TV</a> to replace the Chromecast that was connected to our living room TV. The change was driven by the increase in the number of streaming services/apps that we now use, and which previously was primarily accessed via the Apple TV attached to the TV in our basement. Google TV <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/chromecast-with-google-tv">doesn&rsquo;t look much different</a> than Apple TV, and I imagine Roku isn&rsquo;t much different either. The remote enables voice access to Google Assistant, which I use more than Siri. I did notice that the MLB At Bat app is not the same as the one on Apple TV, but Netflix, Disney+, ParamontPlus, and Amazon all look much the same. Google TV costs much less than Apple TV. Ironically, I set up the Apple TV app and it too looks pretty much the same. I have to chuckle about running Apple TV on a Google product.</p>

If they don&rsquo;t, they won&rsquo;t have a compelling reason for people to buy watches then. The fact that Google bought Fitbit doesn&rsquo;t help the matter.

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering about <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/26/new-moto-wear-os/">the future of Wear OS</a> in light of Google closing the acquisition of Fitbit and that there are so few watches with the new <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-platform">Qualcomm 4100</a> processor. I suspect Google has drastically slowed development on Wear OS and that has forced companies to hold back launching watches with the 4100 because it may be the only new thing about them in the next year. If I am right that may mean we won&rsquo;t see many watches with the latest processor until the fall.</p>
<p>Personally, the Fossil Sport that I currently wear has all the &ldquo;features&rdquo; I need but performance is not exactly reliable. I&rsquo;ve begun to think one of the latest Fitbits might be good. I really wish Apple would do with Apple Watch what they did with the iPod and make it work with Android, which I think would decisively the end Wear OS, but Apple appears committed to the halo Watch gives to iPhone.</p>

			 <p>In this essay,<a href="https://om.co/2021/02/25/the-death-of-a-retailer/">The Death of a Retailer</a>, Om Malik writes fondly about Fry&rsquo;s and its inevitable passing. I agree strongly with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, as is often the case, Fry’s death was inevitable. In Fry’s heyday, many of us built our own computers (or at least tinkered with them). We bought software and installed it. The struggle of being a lover of computers was what made it so special. Every year, however, computers became less cumbersome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come to think about it, &ldquo;the struggle&rdquo; is what captured my imagination about computers and why I still tinker.</p>

			 <p>The article, <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2021/01/30/why-generation-x-will-save-the-web/">Why Generation X will save the web</a>, makes an important point for those concerned about new laws written regarding the Internet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Government and policy – the mechanics and grunt work, not the media showmanship – are powered by an army of hard-working, very young people who have all of the academic knowledge and very little of the practical experience. Those young folks, now, in 2021, who were in nappies when I was on the Hill, now run whatever corridors of power they (virtually) travel through, in professional support of those older politicians.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And it’s these young professionals – not the boomer career politicians – who are setting the tone of internet policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the article suggests, we tend to think it&rsquo;s gray haired Senators, who don&rsquo;t understand the Internet, who are going to write new laws against encryption and other parts of what we call the open Internet, and that is wrong. The laws will be written by millenials who have never known the open Internet. The only Internet millenials know is the bad, closed corporate Internet of Facebook and Twitter and Medium.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they don&rsquo;t protect that which they have never known nor experienced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1806, on the advice of Vice President Aaron Burr (who thought it redundant), the Senate dropped the “previous question” — a motion to end debate and bring an item up for immediate vote — from its rules. Without a motion to call the previous question, however, an individual senator could, in theory, hold the floor indefinitely.</p>

			 <p>Given the number of <a href="https://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pis</a> I have, you might get the impression that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker</a>, but I am not. I&rsquo;ve just been enamored by these small, inexpensive single board computers. The closest I&rsquo;ve come so far to a real project is what I call my desk clock, which is a Pi installed behind a five inch monitor that displays Chromium kiosk mode with a screen I configure using <a href="https://dakboard.com">Dakboard</a>.</p>
<p>I originally built the desk clock using a Raspberry Pi 2 that stopped working a few weeks ago. This past weekend tried to troubleshoot the problem. First I built a new SD card and it seemed to boot fine, but after a few more tests I found that the USB WiFi dongle was not reliably connecting to the home network, so I decided to re-purpose a Pi 3 that was on my desk for the desk clock.</p>
<p>To retain the backup and archive functions that Pi 3 was performing, I moved it&rsquo;s SD card to a Pi 3b+ and then built a new SD card for the desk clock, except this time I cheated by using a pre-built image that dakboard provides.</p>
<p>The net result is that I now have one less Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk. Last night as I was putting things away I found another Pi 3 I already had been storing, which if I had known about would have simplified things, but not resulted in one less Pi on my desk.</p>
<p>For a summary of my Raspberry Pis, expand the <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/techThatIUse.opml#1594992722000">Every Day Tech</a> branch of <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">my Technology outline</a>.</p>

I could revert back to Instaper, but had grown frustrated with it&rsquo;s lack of development.</p>
<p>While I am venting about Pocket, I have a feature request. Provide readers the option that when they are reading an article and then archive that the next article in the list is loaded rather than returning me to the list. The current process really slows down the reading flow for me.</p>

<p>Religious evangelicals may look at these numbers and think, “This is not what the term evangelical means.” The assumption is that the term describes those who place high value on the teachings of the Bible and strive to evangelize other people into their faith. However, that understanding of the term seems to be fading, replaced with a more amorphous concept that melds together religious doctrine and an affinity for conservative politics that experts are only beginning to understand now.</p>

<p>The above is a bug, not a feature. One can argue that the assimilation of Christianity into the Roman Empire in 313 huge negative consequences on Christianity, and it probably was not good for empire either.</p>

			 <p>What&rsquo;s ironic is that every person arrested for the insurrection on the U.S. Capital on January 6, 2021 will expect, and demand, that everyone provide, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence">the presumption of innocence</a>, which requires the accuser to prove by providing evidence in court that the accused commited a crime. Yet, these people wanted state legislatures, the Supreme Court, or Congress to nullify the election results based on their accusuation of voter fraud.</p>
<p>The point being, the people storming the Capital really weren&rsquo;t defending the Constitution nor do they really want to live in the world they think they are fighting for. Presumption of innocence means they have the possibility of not being put in jail by a force greater than themselves and that same presumption of innocence might be the only thing that saved the Republic, this time.</p>

			 <p>The conclusion I reach after reading the New Yorker story, &ldquo;<a href="https://app.getpocket.com/read/3230122334">Among the Insurrectionists</a>&rdquo; is that at the least we live in two Americas, if not in two realities. I also don&rsquo;t see a way for any real resolution because the people described in the article cannot be reasoned with, they only want their way. Democrats can’t fix this, and while Republicans have the only chance, even those who do not &ldquo;comply&rdquo; will not be listened too.</p>
<p>For me, it comes down to principles. Republicans had principles at one time, such as demonstrated by John McCain when he pushed back when someone wanted to brand Obama a Muslim, implying all Muslims are enemies.</p>
<p>The fact that so many Republican members of Congress abetted the insurrection is proof to me that the lust for power and having their own way is far stronger than the principles of democracy.</p>

<p>When Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt established business regulation, a basic social safety net, and government-funded infrastructure in the 1930s to combat the Great Depression that had laid ordinary Americans low, one right-wing senator wrote to a colleague: “This is despotism, this is tyranny, this is the annihilation of liberty…. The ordinary American is thus reduced to the status of a robot. The president has not merely signed the death warrant of capitalism, but has ordained the mutilation of the Constitution, unless the friends of liberty, regardless of party, band themselves together to regain their lost freedom.</p>

I think it gets at a lot of things that people who are unhappy are dealing with. Here is one of the important points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outside of agriculture, more than one in three working Americans belonged to a union in the fifties. In 1983, one in five belonged to a union; by 2019, only one in ten did. Union membership declined; income inequality rose. To explain this, Suzman points to the “Great Decoupling” of the nineteen-eighties: <strong>wages and economic growth used to track each other.</strong> From about 1980, in the United States, the G.D.P. kept growing, even as real wages stagnated. [Emphasis added]</p>

<p>It’s absolutely plausible to me that even more Republicans would have joined this blatant attempt to overturn the election and that their base would mostly have been fine with that. The (self)-coup train wasn’t something that was just for show; it just wasn’t close enough to work this time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is why there must be consequences on the Republican party. Either it needs to do some serious cleanup beyond Trump, or it needs to be further ostracized.</p>

<p>Among my oldest memories are from the seventies watching the World Series, which seemed to always be the New York Yankees versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, with my grandfather and grandmother. Even though my grandfather had strokes that left him speechless he was my father figure and so these are fond memories. My grandfather grew up in Milwaukee and so a fan of the Milwaukee Brewers but the Yankees were the villain and the Dodgers the hero for us during these games. Of course Lasorda was the manager of the Dodgers during those games, so news of his passing brought back these memories today.</p>

All through the last four years my question to Republicans has been, what is your line that Trump could not cross? We found the line was literaly no less than an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States. And these are people who call themselves patriots? If they really want to do the right thing they should resign.</p>
<p>The thing is, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter now. What&rsquo;s going to matter is when in four years and the Republican Presidential primaries start does the party push back against Trump and any who follow his playbook, or do they do all the same things again? It already started when Congress finally reviewed and accpeted the Electoral College results.</p>
<p>At this point I think the lust for supremacy is what Republicans are all about. They could not take a principaled stand until literally forced to by an attempted coup. I for one right now cannot imagine how I can ever trust anyone who is Republican and desires the power of federal office. We cannot let Republicans re-frame the story in a way that does not make them culpable in what happened on January 6, 2021, for they built the platform upon which Trump and his followers spoke and acted, starting with birtherism.</p>

			 <p>As a long time blogger I wonder some time about how blogging has contributed to the current state of politics in the United States. Blogging made it easy to publish to the web and thus made it easy for nearly everyone to publish their opinions. The problem it seems to me is that we have begun to value opinions more than facts or even truth. Trump and his supporters are so firm in their opinion that the election was stolen from him that they think their opinion is fact, and that because something could happen, it did happen, which is the definition of a conspiracy theory.</p>

			 <p>I am using <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/raspberry-pi-4">a Raspberry Pi 4</a> (daenerys) as <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/using-the-raspberry-pi4-as-a-remote-desktop">my desktop personal computer during the work day</a>, which I access from my work provided computer <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/01/04/the-official-images.html">using VNC</a>. By using this Pi 4 I can access the Internet from my desk without going through the corporate Internet proxy.</p>
<p>I built daenerys in <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">a Flirc case</a>, which looks really nice and provides passive cooling, and it boots from a SSD in an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inateck-Inch-Drive-Enclosure-External/dp/B00FCLG65U/ref=pd_lpo_147_t_0/144-8444920-6603364?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00FCLG65U&amp;pd_rd_r=e1377215-a1a4-4ae0-ba6c-f447c6cb3705&amp;pd_rd_w=AoENj&amp;pd_rd_wg=Awfxl&amp;pf_rd_p=16b28406-aa34-451d-8a2e-b3930ada000c&amp;pf_rd_r=P77HN0BMNZCMMG2TEZX4&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=P77HN0BMNZCMMG2TEZX4">Inateck case</a>. The SSD gets power from the Pi and so under normal load I would see temperatures hover around 55 degrees celcius, which is well below the 85 degree threshold that causes the CPU to throttle down.</p>
<p>Over the holiday <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/myTechProjects.opml#1608128858000">I built another Raspberry Pi 4</a> (arya) in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MazerPi-Raspberry-Cooling-Heatsink-Model/dp/B07W3ZMVP1">a MazerPi case</a> that has a fan. The fan draws power from the GPIO pins and has two modes, high speed if plugged in to the 5v pin (PIN 2) and low speed if plugged in to the 3.3v pin (PIN1). To complete the picture, ground is plugged in th PIN 6.</p>
<p>The MazerPi fan just stays on all the time, I am not aware of a way to control the fan so that it only comes on when a certain temperature threshold is past. I first plugged the fan in to one of the 5v pins and found it loud enough to be heard, although not terribly loud. When using high speed mode the CPU temperatures were in the mid to high 30 degree range under normal load. When I ran Octane 2 it then crossed 40 degrees.</p>
<p>I decided to try the low speed mode, which is quiet enough to not hear unless one concentrates. Temperatures where in the 40 to 45 degree range, which is plenty good.</p>
<p>At this point the thought occurred to me that it probably makes sense to use the case with the fan for the Pi that I am going to use every day rather than in one I am going to use as an accessory and thus I removed the SD card from arya and plugged in the SSD from daenerys and it booted right up. (BTW, note that in reality a computer host name is associated with the boot drive and not the actual computer, so daenerys is really the 250 GB SSD drive while arya is a 256 GB SD card.)</p>
<p>Finally, I decided I wanted to try overclocking daenerys, which given the fan should be safe. Normal speed for this Pi4 board is 1.5 GHz, so I decided to overclock it to 2 GHz. Performance is noticably faster. At 1.5 Ghz daenery&rsquo;s Octane 2 score is 8098 and at 2.0 Ghz the score is 9777. Neither score is fantastic, but good enough for the type of web browsing that I do.</p>
<p>When you overclock a CPU it will run hotter and that can cause failures. In the MazerPi, with the fan in low speed mode, and the Pi 4 booting from a SSD and overclocked to a max frequency of 2 GHz and a minimum frequency of 1 GHz I am seeing temperatures ranging from 46 degrees to 55 degress, which is about the same as well using the Pi in the Flirc case but not overclocked.</p>
<p>The net result is that have &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; daenerys to a faster processing speed that provides better performance while maintaining a good CPU temperature and so far after one full working day it has been stable. The MazerPi case cost only $8 and is easy to assemble with help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_stCwXmRiA">a video</a> I found on YouTube.</p>

Today I learned that RealVNC Server is now available for the beta but has to be enabled via the terminal using raspi-config, so I switched. I don&rsquo;t know whether anyone else will find this useful, but it feels like RealVNC is faster than x11vnc.</p>

			 <p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/_1jAuCly20Y/index.html">CNN is airing a documentary</a> about the first modern outsider elected President before Trump, Jimmy Carter. When I think back about Carter&rsquo;s years as President I think what happened is that he showed us reality that we did not like very much. It&rsquo;s no wonder then that he lost to a professional actor and that in many ways we have been living in a delusion that has been amplified by Trump.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would the rock-and-roll set flock to a man who, as president, is remembered today as being a micro-managing, straight-arrow engineer who failed to inspire or understand leadership? The reason is that in his prime, Jimmy Carter was cool. He championed a kind of political populism that was extremely attractive to Americans disillusioned with Washington in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. Sick and tired of elected officials who betrayed them, they found a refreshing change in Carter, a former peanut farmer who was seen as an anti-establishment outsider. As Bishop Michael Curry recalls in the documentary, &ldquo;We were coming out of the Watergate era and looking &hellip;to be a country of integrity again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with the quote above from Bishop Curry is that I am not sure the United States has ever been a &ldquo;country of integrity.&rdquo; I think some of the founders had this aspiration but failed to see the log in their eye of supremacy is the forms of slavery and colonialism.</p>
<p>To me the greatest irony of the Trump presidency has been that part of the campaign slogan, &ldquo;Make America Great&rdquo; is a good and right aspiration but demands a degree of introspection on what is greatness and who determines greatness.</p>
<p>P.S. I observe that it seems all one term presidents of my life time became one term because that were a mirror reflecting ourselves that we did not like very much. Our egos much prefer the myths of our false selves than the reality of our true selves.</p>

			 <p>“The symbol of Christmas—what is it? It is the rainbow arched over the roof of the sky when the clouds are heavy with foreboding. It is the cry of life in the newborn babe when, forced from its mother’s nest, it claims its right to live. It is the brooding Presence of the Eternal Spirit making crooked paths straight, rough places smooth, tired hearts refreshed, dead hopes stir with newness of life. It is the promise of tomorrow at the close of every day, the movement of life in defiance of death, and the assurance that love is sturdier than hate, that right is more confident than wrong, that good is more permanent than evil.” — Howard Thurman <a href="https://email.cac.org/t/ViewEmail/d/71791578E21F49DA2540EF23F30FEDED/3F2D2805E5B983A925D77A725F39070E">source</a></p>

			 <p>Today is the second day of <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/12/21/trying-vivaldi.html">using Vivaldi on the Raspberry Pi 4 desktop</a>, and it continues to perform better for me than Chromium. I decided to run Octane 2 and Speedometer 2 to see how Vivaldi benchmarks against Chromium and I am surprised to find that it benchmarks slightly slower in both even though my practical use finds it faster. For example, Speedometer 2 scores 7.93 in Chromium and 7.614 in Vivaldi. For comparison, the Speedometer 2 score on the iPad Air is 201, fastest in the house.</p>

			 <p>One of the most dangerous ideas that emerged in politics starting in the 1970s is that changing one&rsquo;s mind about a policy or topic is wrong. We heard politicians claim that their opponent &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(politics)#Influence_on_public">flip-flops</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many people have taken this to mean that they must not change their minds about something, but changing one&rsquo;s mind over time is what growing up is all about. Is it any wonder then that people are now so entrenched in their ideas they simply do not listen nor accept anything spoken by someone else that they don&rsquo;t agree with?</p>
<p>The &ldquo;no flip-flop&rdquo; mindset can have dangerous consequences. If scientists aren&rsquo;t willing to consider the possibility that how they thought something happens, like <a href="https://nitter.net/zeynep/status/1341161935904059394#m">how respiratory illness spreads</a>, could be flawed, lives can be lost. Not to mention scientists who don&rsquo;t believe they could be wrong aren&rsquo;t really practicing science.</p>
<p>If you want to really impress me, tell me about something you changed your mind about in the last three years.</p>

			 <p>I use a Raspberry Pi 4 as a personal remote computer that I access using VNC during the work day, which enables me to keep my personal web access from going through my employer&rsquo;s Internet proxy. It&rsquo;s also an excuse of me to fiddle with the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>I have been using Chromium for browing the web but grown frustrated with its performance on the Pi so this morning I decided to give <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> a try. Vivaldi uses the same rendering engine as Chrome and I&rsquo;ve found it uses the same extensions as Chrome, which is important because I need access to Lastpass.</p>
<p>Installation was a little tricky because I am running <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1668160">a beta 64-bit version of the Raspberry Pi OS</a> and so I needed to find the <a href="https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/53927/linux-arm-32-64-bit-os-with-drm-enable-gpu-hardware-accelerated-how-to/2">arm64 version</a> of the installation package.</p>
<p>So far I am finding that Vivaldi does run faster on the Pi4 than Chromium. One thing I did to speed things up is to turn off the drop-down, URL completion of the address bar so that I can quickly enter URLs. However, one function that I use to forage for new updates in the Federated Wiki verse does not work, for some reason, so for now I will need to use Chromium for that part of my daily flow.</p>

			 <p>“Several years ago when I was in Nicaragua, I asked a man if he had time, and he said, “I have the rest of my life,” and smiled. Who of us would possibly say that? That is what we don’t have. What we don’t have is the rest of our lives because we do not even have the now of our lives.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is exactly what we do not have. What decreases in a culture of affluence is precisely and strangely time—along with wisdom and friendship. These are the very things that the human heart was created for, that the human heart feeds on and lives for. No wonder we are producing so many depressed, unhealthy and even violent people, while also leaving a huge carbon footprint on this poor planet.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>I do not take comfort in SCOTUS deciding to not take up Texas' lawsuit against the four swing states. First, SCOTUS simply hid behind procedure and thus were not the adults in the room standing against tyranny. What is even more troubling to me is that I am sure President Trump fully expected &ldquo;his&rdquo; SCOTUS justices to keep him in office, I am sure in his mind that is what they owed him for seating them. The fact that any person considers any judges to be &ldquo;his,&rdquo; particularly Justices is frightening.</p>
<p>What we must learn from this episode of U.S. history is that it matters how anyone who would be President views the powers and responsibilities of the office. The U.S. Constitution is not intended to give anyone extreme powers, its intention is exactly the opposite. The fact that people think elections are all about power shows how much we have strayed from the founding principles of the United States.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t learn from this year and make meaningful changes then all we have done is prevent the end of the U.S. for the time being and increased the likelihood that it will not see its tricentennial. It takes more to preserve freedom than waving a flag and standing for the national anthem.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/trump-constitution-norms.html">Tim Wu makes a good case</a> that the vaunted &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo; of the U.S. constitution has not really shown to be reality. The only thing that has prevented democracy in the U.S. from being overthrown has been the integrity of a frighteningly small number of people.</p>
<p>In my opinion we must not allow Republicans to paint a picture that this threat has only been because of Donald Trump. None of what we have endured is due to just Trump, in fact a case can be made that none of it is on Trump, instead it has all been on the Republican Party. Never forget, Trump won the Republican Party nomination for President, and if he had not then we would have not had four years of a Trump presidency and who knows how many fewer lives would have been saved from the pandemic.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t be patting ourselves on the back thinking democracy prevailed. All that we really have is possibly a victory of one battle, but Republicans have been waging war on the United States since the 1940s and will continue fighting that war in to the future. As long as there is no consequence on Republicans they will remain to be a clear and present danger.</p>

We need to accept what has happened is bad enough to work to prevent it from happening again.</p>

			 <p>I took a look at my Xfinity (Comcast) account again today due to the pending enforcement of their data caps. What I see on Xfinity&rsquo;s site is that while I thought they had turned caps off, it might have been on since July. What bothers me is that it doesn&rsquo;t look like Xfinity provides any warning to users when they are about to exceed their data cap. I thought there was an account configuration so that I could have Xfinity send me an email when I&rsquo;ve consumed 50% and 75% of the data, but I don&rsquo;t see any option. In my opinion, any service that has data caps and corresponding charges when they are exceed should be legally required to provide customers warnings that they are going to exceed those caps.</p>

			 <p>I am still bumming since learning on Friday that <a href="https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2020/12/5/22155774/len-kasper-replacement-cubs-tv-booth">Len Kasper is leaving the Chicago Cubs</a> to be the lead radio announcer for the White Sox. What I like about Len is that he is a genuine baseball guy, he isn&rsquo;t a broadcaster who also does baseball, so moving from TV to radio makes sense. Of all sports baseball is best for radio.</p>
<p>My life experience with the Chicago Cubs has always been narrated by TV play-by-play guys: Jack Brickhouse, Harry Caray, Chip Caray, and Len Kasper. There have been a few others who have been briefly behind the mike, but these are the voices that replay in my head.</p>
<p>The first words are Jack&rsquo;s calling another Dave Kingman home run. Most of the words are spoken by Harry, who was with me from teenager to adult. Chip is sentimental following his grandfathers death, where Len will always be part of the Cubs finally making it to and winning the World Series in 2016.</p>
<p>White Sox fans are getting a great baseball guy to tell them the White Sox story when baseball starts in 2021. I might try to listen to a few games, particularly when the White Sox come to Detroit and Len sits closer to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Harwell">Ernie Harwell&rsquo;s</a> seat. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll watch for who will be next at broadcasting for the Cubs.</p>

			 <p>The restaurant industry in Michigan has been in a huge fight with the state because of indoor dining being shutdown in the state. I understand the industry&rsquo;s point of view because its costing them money and jobs, but the data, such as shown the studies referred to in <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/small-data-big-implications">this article</a>, and common sense, tell me it&rsquo;s not safe to eat indoors at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Even if allowed to, I will not eat in a restaurant until I am vaccinated and this pandemic is under control, for two main reasons. First, one cannot eat and wear a mask at the same time. Second, I have no idea of the air flow within the restaurants I might dine in, and air flow can cause the virus to be spread across greater distances than six feet.</p>

Over the years I&rsquo;ve tried using different keyboard cases with tablets and usually end up setting them aside because I found it too difficult to switch between hand-held and keyboard modes. The magnetic attachment of the iPad to the keyboard makes it easy to remove and re-attach the iPad to the case, so when I want to hold the tablet to read or write notes with the Apple Pencil, it&rsquo;s no more difficult than picking the iPad up off the table and when I want to type notes it&rsquo;s as easy as placing the iPad back on to the magnetic back of the case.</p>
<p>The main negative of the case is that it adds a lot of bulk and weight, so there are times when I won&rsquo;t want to carry both. When we get back to being able to travel around freely I will probably get Apple&rsquo;s Smart Folio, which also attaches magnetically, to protect the iPad Air in those instances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the nation state came to glory in the 19th century, it was as a bulwark against religion.
The great threat of our time is the unity of the state and religion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wish citizens of the United States would think a bit more deeply about our history, particularly the context in which First Amendment was written. The world from 313 AD until when the U.S. Constiution was ratified was basically governed by a theocracy. You had the Holy Roman Empire and Rome ruling most of the western world, then came Protestantism and it&rsquo;s alignment with kings and <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/thirty-years-war">The Thirty Years War</a>, and then, more directly you have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/cofe/cofe_1.shtml#:~:text=Henry%20VIII%20started%20the%20process,borne%20him%20only%20a%20daughter.&amp;text=Henry%20adopted%20the%20title%20given,of%20Defender%20of%20the%20Faith.">the Church of England</a> that emerged to consolidate power in England when Henry VIII wanted an annulment that the Pope would not grant.</p>
<p>The founders knew how those who seek power, be they kings, dictators, oligarchs, and political parties, use religion to increase that power. After all, it&rsquo;s one thing for a President to say something, it&rsquo;s another when a preacher claims what he or she says is the literal word of god.</p>
<p>So, while <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">the first ammendment constrains</a> the U.S. government of what it can do to religions, <strong>more importantly it is intended to prevent the merger of religious and political power.</strong></p>
<p>I agree with Dana&rsquo;s warning about our real risk, which is the emergence of a religious-based rule in the United States. It started with Ronald Regan creating the snowball and rolling it down the hill to create the &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/Yz4AmUaLbUQ">Religious Right</a>&rdquo; under <a href="https://youtu.be/pPsderlzd6c">the pretext</a> of a Pro-Life movement. It picked up more steam to elect George W. Bush that lead to a tremendous amount of lost life in wars authorized by national emergencies that are still not over. And finally in a mutal in-sincere but profitable alliance, enabled and put in place Donald Trump, and with him the breaking of everything Jesus taught.</p>
<p>Please, if you call yourself Christian and find yourself agreeing completely with these claims of religions liberty, stop and consider the very real possibility that your actions are actualy enabling the very opposite of what you think will be the outcome. In the process you are handling over all your authority, necessary for people to even consider the Good News, let alone follow Jesus.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve responded <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/196">to this question</a> about &ldquo;what does one do with ideas&rdquo; with my wish for how products like Roam could be even better for me. In summary, I want an app like Roam that recognizes a string of text as the same as the title of an already existing page and automactically converts it to a link to that page without my having to specify it as such with square brackets.</p>
<p>I think the challenge is putting the &ldquo;new idea&rdquo; in a place that is connected/related in a way that easily re-surfaces. A common practice is to put all ideas in to one bucket/tickler file and then continually reviewing that bucket/tickler file, which itself requires discipline.</p>
<p>Roam has a nice feature that enables me to easily associate text to a future date so when that date arrives the app automatically displays that item. Roam isn&rsquo;t unique in this feature and associating to dates is probably an easy problem to solve, but what I would like would be an automated way associate an idea to a topic that can re-surface whenever I search for or write about the topic.</p>
<p>The closest example I can think of is glossary function in Fargo or wiki links in Roam but even those require remembering special functions, quotes for glossary, square brackets for wiki links. What I would love is to be able to tell software, whenever I write this string of text automatically convert the text to a hyperlink to this page of more information about it. For software to just do it for me it would have to constantly monitor my writing, like MS Word&rsquo;s spell/grammar check.</p>
<p>If memory serves, the closest experience I had to this was VoodooPad and WikiWikiWeb were you wrote in wikiwords like WhereIPutIdeas, that the software automatically converted to links, but that is flawed by the fact that one has to write in an unnatural way.</p>
<p>I guess what I want is some form of natural language processing of all text I write that queries against a collection of previously written pages and automatically links to matches. Even the backlinking in Roam requires some thinking/recollection on my part, unless there is something in Roam I have not yet discovered.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/11/28/i-think-that.html">On Saturday I wrote</a> that I think the real root cause behind why so many align themselves with Trump is the lack of good paying jobs that don&rsquo;t require a college degree. In his recent column for the New York Times, titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/26/opinion/republican-disinformation.html">The Rotting of the Republican Mind</a>, David Brooks pretty much writes the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under Trump, the Republican identity is defined not by a set of policy beliefs but by a paranoid mind-set&hellip;.You can’t argue people out of paranoia. If you try to point out factual errors, you only entrench false belief. The only solution is to reduce the distrust and anxiety that is the seedbed of this thinking. That can only be done first by contact, reducing the social chasm between the members of the epistemic regime and those who feel so alienated from it. And second, it can be done by policy, by making life more secure for those without a college degree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, while Brooks is putting the focus on Republican&rsquo;s, I think the same challenge lies with Democrats. The problem is that Trump and the Republican party really haven&rsquo;t done anything about the problem because they can&rsquo;t see the root cause, which I think is a combination of corporate greed by way of profit margins and a long history of anti-inflation that has conditioned us to seek out the lowest price for items we buy. (Have you ever enjoyed the thrill of finding a bargain?) I don&rsquo;t think either party is willing and able to do what is needed to address this issue.</p>
<p>As a thought exercise ask yourself, why is it that so many of the products you use every day are manufactured outside of the United States? (If you can find a label, take a look at it to see whether I am right or wrong.)</p>
<p>Many politicians of both parties will have you believe the problem is unfair trade practices by countries like China, which is the thinking behind Trump&rsquo;s tariffs that really did not result in more manufacturing jobs in the United States. Trade is a problem, but it&rsquo;s not the only problem.</p>
<p>Corporations do not manufacture in the United States because it costs more to manufacture items in the United States and what does that mean? Higher costs result in lower profit margins and if corporations want to maintain margins, which shareholders want them to do, then they have to increase the price of their products, but the problem with that is U.S. consumers do not like to pay higher prices. It appears something has to give, either corporations take lower profits or consumers pay higher prices. (And equally important because nearly everyone who can save for retirement does with either IRAs or 401ks is that a good number of the shareholders demanding margins that increase stock price are consumers of the products being manufactured.)</p>
<p>Can corporations and shareholders be convinced to live with lower profit margins for the sake of the country? Can consumers be convinced to pay more for items &ldquo;made in the U.S.A.&rdquo;? Can US manufacturing costs, a high portion of which is labor, be decreased?</p>
<p>You see here then the issue, there is no silver bullet, instead there is a need for a comprehensive solution that requires compromise by all parties. Democrats have to be willing to decrease regulations that increase manufacturing costs and Republicans have to be willing to work toward removing corporations' burden of providing healthcare to its employees, which also increases the costs of labor. Serious discussion needs to occur within corporations and their boards of what is a fair profit margin and not just what they can drive the market toward (the starting point might be, what is a fair wage for CEOs?) and there needs to be a significant and continuous, buy made in the USA, marketing campaign to try to influence consumer purchasing.</p>
<p>The irony in all of this is that there was a time when both Republicans and Democrats campaigned on jobs, and jobs/the economy is still the issue now more than ever. The reason why Trump is popular is that his rhetoric and scapegoating resonates with the fear many Americans, particularly those without college degrees, feel. Scapegoating is an addictive drug, one feels good about &ldquo;sticking to it to the libretards,&rdquo; but when/if one looks around for change they will find no change to be found. Consequently, the only option that Republicans seem to have embraced is to keep the rhetoric going so that everyone stays happy enough to keep voting for the people placing the blame, which is themselves.</p>

Unfortunately, the mother of a childhood friend died. I expect these numbers will increase, and I am not OK with that, but unfortunately not enough people share that same point of view.

Right now I am using the keyboard in a very well lit room and therefore I don’t need the keyboard on maximum brightness, but it is and that seems to align to phone screen brightness. You want phone screen brightness to increase outdoors so that you can read the screen, but it seems to me the backlighting of a physical keyboard should be the exact opposite, near zero in bright light, to save battery, and increase in brightness in darker rooms.</p>

			 <p>I think that despite <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/">the analysis of the election</a> around urban/rural and college educated/uneducated the common denominator is jobs. In the United States today it&rsquo;s nearly a given that in order for one to get a good paying job they must have a college degree. It also happens that those jobs are in urban areas. Further, while in the past there were plenty of good paying jobs in manufacturing that didn&rsquo;t require college degrees, we manufacture less in the U.S. than before so an increasing majority of jobs not requiring degrees are in services. Service industries don&rsquo;t pay high wages and are dependent on many external factors, which is why COVID has been so devastating to people in the U.S.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see one solution to the problem, the solution is a combination of decreasing the cost of getting a college degree, increasing existing service industry wages, and somehow increasing manufacturing in the United States. We must seek out and agree upon the incentives for doing each.</p>

<p>I understand the argument made that the government can&rsquo;t make restrictions on churches that they don&rsquo;t make on secular institutions. But when I listened to the above and heard the Bishop state that they only allow 25 to 30 people in to a church designed to hold 500 to 1000 people I wonder, how do they decide on which 25 to 30 can get in?</p>

			 <p>I ordered an open box / reduced price Apple Magic keyboard from Best Buy that I just received. Normally I don&rsquo;t order refurbished items, but I felt an accessory like a keyboard ought to be safe, and after combining the reduced price with some credit card reward points I got $100 reduced on the price.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to the unboxing, cut through the shrink wrap, open the box and all you find is the keyboard inside. I was surprised, given that this was a refurb, that the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; protected plastic wrap was on the keyboard.</p>
<p>There is literally no documentation in the box, I&rsquo;ve had to use Google to learn about some of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096">the standard keyboard shortcuts</a> given that there is no function key row.</p>
<p>I am sitting on a couch with the keyboard with iPad on my lap, typing as I would using any notebook computer. The keyboard is smaller, which is not a surprise given that this is the 11-inch model, but still, I can touch type just fine.</p>
<p>A few things to figure out. There is one function key, a key labeled with a globe at the lower left, that seems to be for selecting emojis, surely there is a way to change that? So far I haven&rsquo;t found one, although I have found some articles of useful information that I summarize below.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://medium.com/indica/i-lived-through-a-coup-america-is-having-one-now-437934b1dac3">The coup</a> has been in progress for four years, and probably even for more years than that. It most recently started with an assault on facts, starting with the numbers of people who did not attend President Trump’s inauguration, continued through three years of assaulting the press, nearly one year of an assault on science and medicine, and now with the assault on the heart of democracy, the election.</p>
<p>The risk is not who will be seated as President on January 21, 2021. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-birther-myth-stuck-around-for-years-the-election-fraud-myth-might-too/">The damage has already been done</a>, going forward all elections will likely be questioned probably until someone comes up with the bright idea of just not having them.</p>
<p>All of this is on the hands of Republicans. To those who say Trump has the right to have his day “in court” I say, when did elections become about courts? There is a phrase, just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should do it. Do you not see the damage you are doing to our country? For now on tens of millions of people will no longer trust elections because you continue to sow the seed of doubt, and for what? So that you can retain power? Did Washington, Madison, Hamilton, and Jefferson fight for power? Did Lincoln give his life for power or did he do it to preserve the Republic? The party of Lincoln indeed.</p>
<p>Here is a fact. What is common between Nixon and Trump is that they are both Republican. One resigned before being impeached and then pardoned, the other was impeached and could still be pardoned. The two most undemocratic Presidents of my lifetime, Republicans.</p>
<p>And finally, to those Regan Republicans, most of whom are of my generation. The USSR had elections, in fact most socialist dictatorships have elections. In the USSR (and now Russia) the outcome of the election was assured before the first vote cast because the person in power could not lose. What makes democratic elections, such as the ones we claim to have in the United States, is that the person in power (the incumbent) can lose. It’s not just about a peaceful transition of power, it’s about accepting the will of the people.</p>
<p>Republican actions right now are saying loudly, they do not accept the will of the people, and in doing they delegitimize their claim as a party of a free and democratic United States of America.</p>

			 <p>It seems to me that another fundamental to our democracy is the fact  that a person can lose an election. Buried in Trump&rsquo;s claims of election fraud is the idea that he couldn&rsquo;t lose so because he did it must be illegit. It&rsquo;s like Putin going into his &ldquo;elections' knowing he will win, except at least this time in the United States Trump does not have Putin&rsquo;s style measures in place to create no doubt about the outcome. In the Unitied States anyone running for office who thinks they cannot lose demonstrates their lack of knowledge or unwillingness to accept the very thing that makes America great! The very thing that makes Trump dangerous is that he sees himself as an autocrat, and such a person should never come close to holding the office.</p>

			 <p>It should be clear that Democrats need to work on their strategy for Presidential elections. If one is willing to listen to me, I have the following observations.</p>
<p>Simply getting out the vote will not work. It seems the conclusion drawn from 2016 is that Clinton lost because not enough Democrats voted. The thinking is based on the belief there are more Democrats than Republicans in the United States. The problem is, increating vote count only works in a pure democratic nationwide election, aka the popular vote, and we don&rsquo;t elect Presidents in the United States by popular vote. (The founders feared a pure democracy.)</p>
<p>Republicans have simplified the path to the White House: win rural votes by &gt; 50% margin and if you get 30% of the urban vote, you win, and that strategy aligns to the electoral college. In short, Democrats have to get more rural vote, which leads me to the one overriding fundamental that Democrats have to understand..</p>
<p><strong>Fear of socialism trumps everything else!</strong></p>
<p>People are not really voting on issues, which I think is why polling is not working. People are voting on fear and mostly fear of the other side. The Republican message is simple, Democrats are socialists, socialism = communism = evil = unAmercan, so vote Republican to save America!  A significant number of people are convinced they can never vote for a Democrat because that is a vote for Socialism. Add to that another significant number of people, call them evangelicals, who are convinced voting for a Demorat is a vote for killing babys and you have this result. And evangelials equate socialism to atheism which adds another reason why they fear Democrats. Then, sadly, add to the fact that there are too many who fear a vote for a Democrat is a vote for people of color over white people.</p>
<p>If you consider that Republican votes are mostly all about fear of what Democrats will do, I think you see how the Democrat primary and compaigns of 2016 and 2020 make the election strategy for Republicans easy because policies considered to be socialist AND politicians considered to be socialists (Bernie Sanders) dominated the campaigns.</p>
<p>In short, I think Bernie Sanders created a lot of fear among voters AND was a easy target. Even after Biden secured the nomination Republicans simply claimed Sanders would have significant influence over Biden because Democrats do want the Sanders followers support. I think this is true, hard to dispute and personally frustrating to me because Bernie is not even a Democrat!</p>
<p>Why does this matter? It matters because for extremism to be successful it needs an equally extreme opposite. The antidote to extremism is the middle and unfortunately that is shrinking rapidly. I think the only way the middle, call them moderates, can be recovered is via a third party but how we finance and run elections in the United States in the 21st century really makes it impossible for a viable third party.</p>
<p>In summary, fear of socialism trumps everything. It don&rsquo;t matter whether the Republican candidate is authoritarian, unqualified, and incapable of leading, it only matters that at Democrat doesn&rsquo;t get power and destroy the country.</p>

Others see that government as necessary, the problem is that it is not as effective as it should be. These others are Democrats and used to be a good number of Republicans too.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;The founders were well aware of the dangers of populism, demagoguery, and faction. They built a constitutional order designed to force compromise and impede sociopathic behavior. But the institutions they put in place to act as gatekeepers (the Electoral College, the appointed Senate) became obsolete, and the successor gatekeepers (political bosses, smoke-filled rooms, big media) came to seem undemocratic and lost their grip. Today, the road to power for a sociopath or demagogue is comparatively unobstructed. As a result, the fail-safes designed to protect the system when the settings go out of alignment have themselves begun to fail.&rdquo; (nationalaffairs.com, <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/rethinking-polarization?smid=nytcore-ios-shar">Rethinking Polarization</a>)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>COVID-19 is <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/top-causes-death-united-states-heart-disease-cancer-and-covid-19/">the third highest cause of death</a> in the United States from February to October of 2020.  One of the problems we have is how people are viewing these deaths. Rather than viewing them as an &ldquo;event&rdquo; caused death, like 9/11, people are viewing as a disease caused death, like heart disease, cancer, and strokes. In this case they are thinking, hundreds of thousands of people die from disease every year and this is the same.</p>
<p>The reason why this matters is that some people who view these deaths as similar to other diseases are more willing to view the 200K+ deaths as acceptable, but what they are not taking in to account is that all of the other diseases on the list have known preventative measures, treatments, and expected impacts, whereas we have none of these for COVID-19. The number of deaths of the other diseases would be higher each year if not for the years and years worth of science to lower the risk.</p>
<p>Further, neither heart disease or cancer, which are the two higher causes of death so far this year, are something in which a health person contracts the disease and can die in a matter of days or even weeks.</p>
<p>The point is that we should all be angry about the number of people who have died from COVID-19, particularly if we claim to place a high value on life. Surely, like all other places around the world, some people would have died no matter what, but nobody should view 200K+ deaths as acceptable and the problem is there is not true end in sight because there is zero leadership in the United States toward anything that resembles a plan.</p>
<p>The closest to what appears to be the plan is to just let the disease run its course. Perhaps another 100+ or more people will die, and too many people are ok with that so long as they can go wherever and do whatever they want to do. Meanwhile other nations in the world took active measures and controlled the very same disease we seem unwilling to fight, and did so for the sake of everyone in their country!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript">United States Declaration of Independence</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conservaties believe that the natural rights enumerated above are paramount to any and all laws, orders, and rulings of the U.S. government. The pandemic raises the question though of whether the right to liberty, which appears to be translated by most as meaning the right to do anything they want, stands above the right to life.</p>
<p>Ironic isn&rsquo;t it, that as we begin to witness another series of SCOTUS confirmation hearings, we are witnessing this very debate in which Republicans insist that the right to life is paramount over the liberty of a woman to choose what to do with her body. No matter then the hypocrisy of these same Republicans insisting their right to liberty is paramount over everyone else&rsquo;s right to life. Well, if you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-sen-mike-lee-says-rank-democracy-bad-for-america-2020-10">seek the common denominator</a> you might find there really isn&rsquo;t any hypocricy.</p>

			 <p>It seems logical to me that the number of cases of COVID-19 will increase as the weather gets colder in the northern United States causing people to spend more time indoors without good ventilation. <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2020/10/11/michigan-again-at-high-risk-for-virus-outbreak-amid-worry-of-2nd-wave-data-shows/">A report</a> over the weekend appears to provide the statistical evidence, the R0, or rate of infection, has jumped to 1.12, you want it to be below 1. Daily new cases per 100,000 people is 11.7, a number above 10 is considered high. The good news is that ICU occupancy is low so for now hospitals appear to be capable of meeting demand, but an increase in the rate of spread increases the probability of people with pre-existing conditions who catch the virus need hospitalization. Lending further support to the &ldquo;colder weather&rdquo; theory is the fact that the new Michigan outbreak is in the Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>Given the Michigan Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision that the Governor has over-stepped her authority with her efforts to contain the disease and the Republican party&rsquo;s preference to not issue mandates, it is likely the spread will increase unless citizens self comply or take county and city health orders seriously. I expect the State Legislature to pass legislation to prevent counties and cities from issuing their own health orders.</p>

			 <p>I have a great deal of respect for the people who layed the foundation of the computer technology I use today, people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/">Dan Bricklin</a>, <a href="http://about.fed.wiki/view/ward-cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>, and <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>. I follow Ward and Dave the closest because they actively write and because I use their work every day.</p>
<p>I am struck by the similarities and differences  between Ward and Dave&rsquo;s work. Ward created wiki, which is a tool he created to write and share pattern languages. Wiki&rsquo;s emphasis is on easy writing and hyperlinking, which I think was the intended purpose of the Web. Dave also created writing tools, the outliner and blogs, that simplify publishing of writing on the Internet and he also created RSS to make it easier for one to keep up with the writing on the Internet. Dave&rsquo;s original work is the conceptual basis for <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my stream</a> while Ward&rsquo;s original work provides the tools for <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">my garden</a>.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/">outlines</a> and find that I really like <a href="https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki">Federated Wiki</a> and today I realized that the similarity between them is that both provide context to writing but in different ways. Outlines are hiearchical while Federated Wiki has a lineup that shows context between source and destination links in a horizontal and linear fashion. I think this ability to easily see context and connections is also why I like <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> and use it for my private notes.</p>
<p>I am not sure that this matters much to others, but I think there is a relationship between context and history. History is the context of our lives and I think a great deal of our problems come from a failure to see meaning or to see what is really happening because we fail to know the context. Part of the problem may be that it&rsquo;s too difficult to find the context of history, that&rsquo;s where tools like oultliners might help, and because it is so difficult few people really take the time to seek out and understand context.</p>
<p>Context is needed for true understanding, knowledge, and thus wisdom and today there is a huge deficiency of wisdom.</p>

I find my reaction is less about whether or not I agree with Om as much as the fact that he appears to associate Amercia&rsquo;s not decline with wealth. Fixation on wealth as a measure of success is a uniquely human problem that is becoming more problematic, particularly for the United States. Should freedom and liberty be defined in wealth terms?</p>

			 <p><a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/price-drop-grab-the-lenovo-usi-stylus-for-only-32/">The Lenovo USI Stylus</a> arrived today, giving me the first chance to try a <a href="https://universalstylus.org/">Universal Stylus Initiative</a> digital pen. Historically, digital pens only work with the tablets made by the manufacturer of the pen, and the pens are not portable between tablets. USI is a protocol intended to enable one to use a pen across multiple tablets. Thus, the Lenovo stylus I just got is supposed to not only work with the Lenovo Duet, but other tablets and notebook computers that support USI.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have another device that supports USI, but I can say that the stylus I received just worked with the Duet once I got the pen powered up, there was no pairing process. The problem that I have with this stylus is that its tip is too big and round and so writing with it is like writing with a used medium tip marker rather than like a fine point pen. The tip on the Apple Pencil and Microsoft Surface Pen is much more like a pencil or pen so that what you write on the screen does not look like big fat characters.</p>
<p>The upside to the Lenovo USI is that it only cost me $31, which is considerabily cheaper than the Apple Pencil. However, even if it is cheap, the fact that one cannot really write digital ink that approximates a fine tip pen will hinder its usefullness.</p>

			 <p>I am thinking that the state of COVID-19 in the United States may be less of a failure of leadership than we want to think. Imagine if this happened while Obama were President. Yes, the response would be more efficient, like hospital supplies would be better managed, but I think the people refusing to do the right things now, like wearing masks and social distancing, would refuse to do them with Obama as President.The same Republican Governors and state legislatures would do the same thing they are doing now.</p>
<p>In many ways the U.S. response to COVID-19 is the same as how respond to mass shootings, no matter where they occur. We are trapped in a selfish, individualistic mindset fueled by capitalists and religious and taken advantage of by the power brokers.</p>

<p>The purpose of wearing a mask is so that one may not spread the virus to others.

This act alone is a violation of Trumps oath of office, but since grown ups who identify Republican were incapable of standing up to him and removing him from office when they had the chance, they get to suffer the consequences. (Republicans, when will you face the fact that Trump is not one of you and doesn&rsquo;t care about you?)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strategically speaking, it weakens any credibility that the US has, in terms of being a competent global leader prepared to confront threats. &quot;</p>
<p>Making America Great? Greatness is not self declared, it is determined by consensus of others. If I say I am great, I am being arrogant. America&rsquo;s greatness is thus truly determined by the people who live in countries other than the United States of America.</p>
<p>We were first considered great in 1787 when we did something never done before by creating a nation governed by citizens rather than ruled by monarchs. Any doubt was removed by the end of World War II when we saved the world from fascism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we got drunk on our own press clippings, puffed our chest, and started trying to impose our superiority upon the world, first in Korea, then in Vietnam, and as we started losing the &ldquo;war&rdquo; in Vietnam the government declared war on its own citizens, which has been raging toward the near boiling point that we are experiencing now.</p>
<p>It turns out to be great you do have to care about others. Nobody ever thought to be great was so self centered as to not be willing to sacrifice for the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main overarching issue, which has been the issue since the 2016 election, is Trump says X, and Democrats and progressives say, “Can you believe he just said X?” That’s the problem</p>

<p>Compare this to the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, which gained a positive reaction from Republicans simply because he was &ldquo;angry.&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s strategy is to appear stronger than Biden, but the thing is his definition of strength is not the same as many other&rsquo;s definition.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I do too, and there is nothing wrong with that, record keeping is important. In my work I take notes to record what I did and I often have do search for things along the lines of &ldquo;when this last broke, what did we do?&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>Here is a question that all Americans, particularly Republicans, should ask themselves. When Al Gore conceded the 2000 election, was he being a patriot by putting country over his personal ambitions or was he being weak?</p>
<p>And if you are Republican, honestly ask yourself if your answer would be different if Gore were a Republican.</p>
<p>As we head in to this Presidential election your answer to this question might be the most consequential one of your lifetime. A test of patriotism happens only when you put something bigger like your country above your own self interests like your tribe.</p>

			 <p>I am not surprised that Republican Senators who otherwise seem to oppose Trump, like Romney, are all in on getting their Supreme Court Justice approved. The whole reason why they have been tolerating Trump is to get those Justices and there is no way they are not going to claim that prize. Further, I think they see it it likely Trump will lose and it is possible they could lose the Senate, so that have to do it now or never. Republicans are long past the point where fairness matters, and their constituency is only their tribe and not Americans in general. From their point of view, given Supremes are for life, SCOTUS is their last chance to secure <strong>their way of life</strong> for the next decade.</p>

			 <p>I am interested to see how Microsoft sticks with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo?activetab=overview&amp;cid=msft_web_collection">Surface Duo</a>. They must have a long term plan because I can&rsquo;t imagine there are high sales expectations given the price and COVID. So, there must be planned iterations that improve performance and get the price down to a point where it is more affordable to more people. The other thing to watch is, whether the Surface Neo sees the light of day. You might recall it as the larger &ldquo;booklet&rdquo; Surface that Panay showed last year, but it would run Windows 10x. My understanding is that the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview&amp;cid=msft_web_collection">Surface Pro X</a>, which is the ARM Surface, is not exactly flying out of stores.

A reason might be that not once did he refer to the price and thus didn&rsquo;t get in to the &ldquo;for this price one should not have these problems&rdquo; trope. IMHO any gadget priced north of $1K is too expensive even if it works perfectly!</p>
<p>So, if price is an issue, save the time and the pixels and just write, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too expensive&rdquo; and move on. Because Kevin is not on a mission to drive home the point that the device is too expensive, he focuses more on the actual problems and frankly, what he writes about seem to be something that Microsoft could address in software updates.</p>
<p>The most important point that Kevin makes, though, is about the biases toward what the Duo is, even though Microsoft has emphasized it is not a phone or a tablet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think people are calling the Duo a phone because that&rsquo;s the closest device comparison they can make. And I get that. But the Duo truly is something different and, along with other folding or swivel screen devices, early in the trend of a new device class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I like this thought&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And although Microsoft dubbed it the Duo over a year ago, I think the company should have said that &ldquo;Duo&rdquo; is just an internal product code name. A better, more descriptive name would have been Surface Booklet because that&rsquo;s really what it is: A connected book-like tablet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/09/11/it-is-easy.html">I noted before</a> that Brad Sams also took effort to emphasize the Duo being a class on its own, although he used device classification of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).</p>

<p>It is easy to say the Duo is a smartphone but when you look at how Microsoft is promoting the hardware, to me, this is device reminds me more of the PDAs of the early 2000s than of the smartphones of the 2020 era.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://petri.com/surface-duo-review-the-pursuit-of-productivity">Brad Sams' review of the Microsoft Duo</a> is the first I&rsquo;ve seen that calls it a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which I suspect is a better categorization than smartphone or tablet. The problem again comes back to price, it&rsquo;s just way too expensive and doesn&rsquo;t not provide enough for that expensive beyond being a niche product.  My hope is that Microsoft and Google don&rsquo;t give up on it too soon and find a way to get the price down.</p>

Compare reviews of the Google Pixel 4a and the Microsoft Duo, in some ways they are the same, but because the 4a only costs $350 the issues are understandable or overlooked. Devices priced at $1k or higher need to be perfect; the Duo appears to be a beta, akin to Google Glass.</p>

While I think Woodward withheld what he learned earlier in the year for the sake of book sales, I am not convinced that reporting what he had or even playing the tapes would have made any difference. Republican Senators had plenty of evidence to find Trump guilty and ignored that for sake of party, THEY are the ones most at fault for the loss of lives and we ought not forget it. At this point the only remedy is to vote Trump out of office.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Just remember this: no one can keep you from the second half of your own life except yourself. Nothing can inhibit your second journey except your own lack of courage, patience, and imagination. Your second journey is all yours to walk or to avoid. My conviction is that some falling apart of the first journey is necessary for this to happen, so do not waste a moment of time lamenting poor parenting, lost job, failed relationship, physical handicap, gender identity, economic poverty, or even the tragedy of any kind of abuse. Pain is part of the deal. If you don&rsquo;t walk into the second half of your own life, it is you who do not want it. God will always give you exactly what you truly want and desire. So make sure you desire, desire deeply, desire yourself, desire God, desire everything good, true, and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They = the United States Senate but many Republican voters too.</p>
<p>The House plainly made the case for impeachment and the Senators had the evidence AND STILL did not care enough to impeach.</p>
<p>They are ok with an authoritarian as President so long as that person is in their party. Funny how much they complained about Obama&rsquo;s executive actions, but have no problem with Trump doing the same thing, and more.</p>
<p>The consequences? 176,991 American&rsquo;s dead on U.S. soil.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read two articles this week that make the case for treating Computer Science as something other than Computer Science. The one, titled, <a href="https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/8/246368-why-computing-belongs-within-the-social-sciences/fulltext">Why Computing Belongs With The Social Sciences</a>, argues that we will not gain more ethical computing from college curricula that have &ldquo;Computing Ethics&rdquo; classes but only by moving Computing in to the Social Sciences. The author points to the increasing relationship between algorithms and power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recommendation algorithms, automated sanctioning systems, reactive violation detection and prediction systems, and nudge architectures are replacing the human agency built into our legal and political systems with an architecture of unknowable black boxes allowing the one-way surveil and control of people without any corresponding contestation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an essay titled <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters</a>, Paul Graham notes that while he graduated with a Computer Science degree, he self identifies as a hacker, which is the likely image most people have of one who holds a CompSci degree. Graham says that hackers are like painters and writers because they make things. The following is for me the most important quote in the essay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one. Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are practically solipsists. It&rsquo;s hard for such people to design great software [5], because they can&rsquo;t see things from the user&rsquo;s point of view</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both articles resonate strongly with me. I graduated in 1989 with a Computer Science degree and have been working in the Information Technology industry for more than thirty years and I can say that I have never used any of the specifics of my computer science classes save for one, one Software Engineering. I also got a minor in secondary education and what gained from that part of my college learning I applied frequently throughout my career.</p>
<p>In my experience computing is more art than a science and more about humans than machines and yet neither of these realities were part of my formal computer science education. Granted, much time has passed since I graced the college classrooms so I know curricula has changed, but yet given the &ldquo;market&rdquo; pressures on colleges I suspect the most focus on producing employable graduates, with life long skills a secondary benefit rather than primary focus.</p>

			 <p>Last year, about Chicago Cubs, <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/08/17/go-cubs-go.html">I wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem is not the hitting, although they could be more consistent. To me the problem is the bullpen, they are giving up too many runs in the 6 thru 9th innings. Nobody in the pen is reliable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could not imagine that at the same time a year later the Cubs would be playing under such strange circumstances like they will today, playing two seven inning games in a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; double-header. Yet, while the Cubs have the best record, the bullpen performance has not been much different.</p>

			 <p>It seems to me that comparing something that is intended to create a new category of device against current categories is flawed. My read of <a href="https://4thquadrant.io/freearticles/business-models/microsofts-surface-duo-not-a-product-review/">this take on the Microsoft Surface Duo</a> is that it is designed for productivity, smartphones are not designed for productivity, but we will compare it to smartphones anyway.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the real problem with the Surface Duo is its price. Anything that requires one to spend &gt;$1,000 demands more discretion. Right now the price is a barrier to entry that is going to prevent Microsoft from selling many units.</p>

			 <p>In a blog post today Om Malik asks, <a href="https://om.co/2020/08/13/gig-economy-work/">What is work?</a> and I think he touches on a root cause of Trumpism. Basically, many people have a hard time seeing a future in which they have a good paying job and nobody seems to have an answer. Democrats are supposed to support labor via union representation, but instead appears to be in bed with corporations and the wealthy as much as Republicans. The traditional Republican Party has no better answers, leaving a vacuum that allows for the scapegoating that Trump promotes.</p>
<p>Except, scapegoating is itself a misdirection no different than anyone else because it puts focus on China and not on the corporations that use Chinese labor. Pick up anything and you will likely find a &ldquo;made in China&rdquo; sticker, but is that the fault of China or the &ldquo;American&rdquo; company who sell the product? And what if American&rsquo;s hunt for the bargain that pushes change companies toward low cost labor so they can maintain profit margins?</p>

			 <p>Perhaps the most important skill we learn in life is how we make decisions. Too little time is spent reflecting on this skill in ourselves, and evaluating it in leaders. How we see the world influences the decisions we make. If everything that happens is viewed through the lense of how it affects me personally, for example, does this help or hurt my chances for re-election, then most of the decisions I make are for my own self interest. (Note that very, very few people do NOT make any decisions in their self interest. I am talking about degree)</p>
<p>I suggest that over the course of history, those who history says are good leaders put common interest above their own in the moments that matter. For me the decision making process is a core competency of anyone who I consider to recognize as leader and who may gain my vote in an election.</p>
<p>Incumbents have the blessing or curse of having demonstrated how they make decisions, and thus tend to have an easier or sometimes bigger hurdle to overcome.</p>

			 <p>I just transferred music I had uploaded to Google Play Music to YT Music because Google is shutting down Play Music next month. A few years ago I had uploaded all the music I had ripped from CDs to Play Music as a form of online backup, and I always appreciated the fact that I could access that music using the Play Music app on my Android devices, and I can cast my music to any of my Chromecasts and Google Home devices. Much to my surprise and disappointment, I have found that YT Music only lets me cast music to one of my Chromecast devices and tells me if I want to cast to others, like Google Home, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/54547361?hl=en">I need to upgrade to premium</a>. WTF?</p>

			 <p>I am one of the many people who used and really liked the DarkSky weather app on Android. While the Android app is great, the main reason why I bought the premium subscription was for the Wear OS app. Now that Apple bought DarkSky and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/android-version-of-popular-dark-sky-weather-app-shuts-down/">shutdown the Android app</a>, I&rsquo;ve lost the DarkSky app and complications on my watch.</p>
<p>I switched to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accuweather.android&amp;hl=en_US">the AccuWeather app</a> on my smartphone, but while it does have a Wear OS component, it is really bad in comparison to DarkSky and doesn&rsquo;t have complications. I am hoping AccuWeather beefs up the Wear OS app over time. The whole DarkSky aquisition by Apple was really disappointing.</p>

			 <p>Today is a primary election day here in Michigan and we voted from home for the first time. Some notes regarding voting from home now that I experienced it first hand. First, while it is most often referred to as &ldquo;vote by mail&rdquo; one can actually hand deliver their ballots at the township clerk&rsquo;s office. In my case the township have several outside, 24x7 lock boxes and an internal (available during business hours) lock box. The point being, one is not constrained to using the USPS for delivery of their ballot. Second is that if I am honest, we probably would not have voted in this election because it is a primary, so &ldquo;voting from home&rdquo; caused me to participate in government as intended.</p>

The con is all about sowing doubt, and the fact that a POTUS is even willing to suggest it says all that one needs to know. Trump never has understood nor appreciated the Constitution nor the Republic for which it stands, and that was known at the time when he was impeached by the House. In fact, it&rsquo;s basically why he WAS IMPEACHED! Republicans have been aiding the con since he took office and had a chance to do the right thing in the impeachment trial. You might try to save face, but any claims you make now you bring also on yourself. Any statements to the contrary to anyone who call themselves a Federalist is laughable.</p>

			 <p>We went on our biggest trip in months, to the east side (Auburn Hills) to deposit some checks at our bank, then all the way back west to Novi before picking up something to eat and go back home. Maybe 40 miles of driving, some of it even on a freeway. This is what is now considered excitement due to COVID.</p>

			 <p>If you start with the premise that there is a relationship between privacy and liberty, then you might find it ironic that Europe has overcome the United States as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">the world advocate for liberty</a>. The United States has been in the process of becoming a police state since the early 1970s, when the Federal government started viewing some U.S. citizens as enemy combatants under slogans like &ldquo;War On Drugs&rdquo; and &ldquo;War On Crime.&rdquo;  And despite thoughts to the contrary, Trump is all in on the evolving police state just like former U.S. Presidents or representatives.</p>

			 <p>I see <a href="https://twitter.com/RexChapman/status/1283153317095505920">a video snippet</a> of Mike Pence saying &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want CDC guidance to be a reason for not opening schools.&rdquo; First reaction is WTF not?</p>
<p>The second reaction is that there are two big issues at play here. One is &ldquo;anti-elitism,&rdquo; which is a point of view of which there are no experts to trust, everyone should just &ldquo;go with their gut&rdquo; or &ldquo;use common sense.&rdquo; In most Republican circles &ldquo;elites&rdquo; are Democrats or liberals to be ignored out right.</p>
<p>The second issue is relationship between federal and local governments. It&rsquo;s clear that the Republicans in charge right now think there is no legitimate role for the federal government beyond defense. In their eyes the federal government has no responsibility for solving &ldquo;big problems&rdquo; of the nation. In some ways their view of government is more Articles of Confederation than U.S. Constitution. (I find it ironic that a Conservative group calls themselves The Federalist Society but acts more anti-federalist.)</p>
<p>Stated differently, current Republicans take Reagan&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;The Federal government is not the solution, the federal government is the problem&rdquo; very literally, and apparently lost on them is the irony that the words were spoken by a man seeking the position of being the top person of that federal government.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently purchased a Lenovo Duet, which is a Chrome OS 2-in-1. I am a long time Chromebook user and own a Pixelbook, but the Duet is the first Chrome OS tablet I&rsquo;ve used and the first time that I&rsquo;ve installing other Android browsers like Brave. Chrome OS really doesn&rsquo;t like that there is more than one browser on the Duet because every time I click a hyperlink I get a prompt asking me which browser I want to open it in. There should be a way to override this so I can tell Chrome OS only open hyperlinks in Chrome and don&rsquo;t bother asking me, but I haven&rsquo;t found one it exists.</p>

			 <p>The irony of our time is that the phrase on those hats, &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; were prophetic four years ago. The problem is that Americans don&rsquo;t seem to understand that greatness is not self-declared. Greatness can be aspirational but for it to be so requires an understanding of how others define greatness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the eve of America’s anniversary—our two hundred and forty-fourth—much of the world believes that the country is racist, battered and bruised. “Europe has long been suspicious—even jealous—of the way America has been able to pursue national wealth and power despite its deep social inequities,” Robin Niblett, the director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, also known as Chatham House, in London, told me.</p>

			 <p>I’ve made two purchases from Best Buy online since COVID-19, which is a bit unusual because I normally order from Amazon. What I am even more surprised by is that I prefer Best Buy’s shipping because they use UPS. I find Amazon’s in-house delivery random and unpredictable where as UPS deliveries are part of a regular route by the same guy at nearly the same time. Further, they provide GPS tracking of the delivery truck so I can see where my package is in route to my house on the day of delivery, which enables me to be ready to receive the package so it isn’t waiting outdoors. I also get text messages of the delivery status. Amazon provides notices but no real tracking. Further, since Amazon delivery is random, packages can end up in all sorts of strange places. Amazon saves money, but I find their customer service has taken a hit in the process.</p>

I understand the thinking they don&rsquo;t want to repeat the 1980 Democrat Primary in which Ted Kennedy challenged their incumbent POTUS candidate, Jimmy Carter, but their current course of path is more damaging.  At this point in the past the party would have split, with a new, party formed supporting a more viable candidate.</p>

			 <p>Unions have a place in protecting labor and there really is no institution that protects and advocates in behalf of labor than unions. Historically Democrats have been supported by unions because they tend to support pro-labor policies, but they aren&rsquo;t dedicated solely to labor. Democrats pushed NAFTA, which wasn&rsquo;t a good thing for labor in the U.S.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like everything in life, unions can be abusive. Like the idea taking a look at the scope of work for police departments, and perhaps thinking of ways to handle them differently, the same should be done with unions. We have to keep the good things that unions do and <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/09.html#a174718">not simply disband them</a>, in fact, I think we need stronger advocacy for ALL labor that includes both traditional blue collar and white collar jobs.</p>

It made me think that one of many problems we have is that we want believe we live in a simple, dualistic world, but that is not reality. It takes awareness of oneself and the willingness to spend the time to grow to embrace the both/and-ness of reality.</p>

			 <p>Dave Winer makes <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/01/142621.html?title=morningCoffeeTweets#a150749">a very good point</a> about how Trump has handled COVID-19. A competent politician should easily gain re-election in a time of national crisis simply by being a unifying force. The fact that he hasn&rsquo;t done so is a clear example of his incompetence that Republicans should really be concerned about. As much as we claim we don&rsquo;t like politicians and think anybody can be President, the basic skills needed for the job in a Democracy is political. You wouldn&rsquo;t hire a mechanic to fix your car who doesn&rsquo;t have the experience nor the skills to actually repair the car. Trump is not competent for the position of President of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The police and the U.S. military are separate institutions because policing a community and fighting a war are supposed to be separate jobs. In traditional “wars,” both sides are heavily armed. In Minnesota, only the agents of the state appear to be wearing body armor and carrying long guns. And yet: State officials are calling this “warfare” on official public channels.</p>

<p>I think it began with the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/crime/the-war-on-drugs">War On Drugs</a>&rdquo; in the 70s and 80s that turned the United States into an incarceration state.</p>

			 <p>Is communication on a corporately owned platform communication on a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-social-media-executive-order/">public square</a>? I don&rsquo;t think so. The first amendment <em>constrains governments</em> from impeding free speech. In other words, it protects citizens from government, not the other way around. Citizens United endowed corporations with rights of citizenship, so then Isn&rsquo;t Trumps executive order really an impediment on Twitter&rsquo;s free speech rights?</p>

			 <p>I think the COVID-19 response exposes a problem with the current state of lack of trust created through an increase in extreme points of view, both left and right. Consequently, people now seem to only trust what they can see with their own eyes or what make sense to them. Therefore, people are less likely to take COVID-19 seriously until they are personally affected in some way.</p>
<p>For such people, <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144355">a young person&rsquo;s account of surviving COVID-19</a> published by the New York Times is not believed because they don&rsquo;t trust the New York Times. Likewise anything <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144838">published by the NewYorker</a>. <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144627">A blogger&rsquo;s first hand account</a> is meaningless because I don&rsquo;t know the blogger.</p>
<p>In short, the problem cannot be placed on external entities that are not trusted. The problem isn&rsquo;t with journalism not doing something so much as journalism having no credibility from an extremist point of view unless that journalist is identified as having the same extremist point of view.</p>

<p>Howard Stern echos something I&rsquo;ve said for a while, but I think what may be the case is that these people don&rsquo;t necessarily love Trump himself so much as what he represents to them, which they personally identify with. They see themselves in Trump&rsquo;s persona and thus any negative statement about him is translated as a personal attack in them. To these people we are deep within a class war between &ldquo;elites&rdquo; and what they believe are &ldquo;normal people,&rdquo; which they define as anyone who agrees with and acts like them, and which they call &ldquo;common sense.&rdquo; The war began when Newt Gingrich ascended to Speaker of the House.</p>

			 <p>I am one of many people who really like the note-taking app called <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> that is currently in beta. However, it seems some think that bidirectional note linking is the primary feature of Roam, and while I think bidirectional note linking is a differentiator it is not the only reason why I prefer Roam.  For me the main reason why I like Roam is that it is an outliner for developing and maintaining a wiki that automatically supports bidirectional links.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried <a href="https://www.amplenote.com/blog/bidirectional_note_linking_and_an_offer_for_roam_exporters">amplenote.com</a> that claims to be an alternate to Roam that supports bidirectional links, and I does in fact do a very good job of importing content from Roam. However, Amplenote is not an outliner and I quickly found that true outlining, not just bullet lists, is a must have requirement for me.</p>

			 <p>I think the real problem with transitioning to the current state of lockdowns to something that resembles normal is that doing so requires cooperation from everyone to a degree that doesn’t seem possible today.

<p>Unfortunately we live in a world where selfishness and greed is the default expectation. In that world in which you cannot count on people to do the right thing, someone has to be a parent and that means the government.</p>

			 <p><a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml">Dave Winer</a> has been releasing updates to <a href="http://littleoutliner.com">Little Outliner</a>, which is a browser based implementation of his outlining tools.</p>
<p>Little Outliner creates and edits outlines written in OPML, which is an XML-based file format for outlines that Dave created. If you only need to view and edit files, Little Outliner is all you need. Dave recently released <a href="http://my.this.how/davewiner/howtos.opml">a web service that renders an OPML file as a web page</a>, the net result is a simple way to create a nice looking web page. I&rsquo;ve decided to use this to create <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml">my /now page</a>, all I have to do is edit the file in Little Outliner. You will find the link to this page in the footer the pages on this site.</p>
<p>You may notice that the subheads in the page have a littlle upside down triangle, those are parent nodes of the source outline, the following indented text are children nodes. If you click the triangle the node will collapse, click it again and it expands. By default all of the nodes render as expanded but you can configure a node to collapse by default. Click node you want to configure as collapsed, then click the suitecase icon on the left toolbar, click the plus button on the Edit attributes window;  in the left field enter collapse, in the right field enter true, and then click Save. Refresh the web page and you see node/head you configured will be collapsed.</p>

			 <p>Trump seems to think the most important measure of his success is the stock market. The reality is that the stock market is driven significantly by emotions, either confidence (bull) or fear (bear). The only tool a President really has in relation to the stock market is his or her ability to lead. People know leadership when they see it, and they look for leadership for confidence and void of seeing such leadership have fear. Consequently, the stock market is telling us much of what we need to know about President Trump and that is he is not a leader, but this was obvious in 2016 to anyone willing to see beyond the theater perpetrated by Trump and everyone around him. After we get through this crisis I wonder whether we will truly place blame where it belongs, which is how a person of Trump&rsquo;s deep character flaws and probable mention disorder was elected. We need to truly look at how we elect Presidents and make changes&hellip;. that or Congress has to get a whole less political and much more representative of ALL Americas and execute it&rsquo;s oversight obligations given it by the Constitution. (The Senate had it&rsquo;s chance of saving tens of thousands of lives when it had the chance to remove Trump from office.)</p>

			 <p>Trump has been running for re-election from the first day after he was elected President. A politician constantly running for re-election cannot lead, and we need leadership. The leader we need now has only one objective, to save as many lives in the near term and long term as possible. I don&rsquo;t know if such a leader exists, worse I am not sure the American people have the will to allow such a leader to exist.</p>

			 <p>“The relationship between America and China was not “normal” before COVID-19. It was in rapid decline. And that decline has left Americans more vulnerable to the disease. The lesson of this plague isn’t that America should stop cooperating with China. It’s that America must rebuild the public-health cooperation that the Trump administration helped destroy.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-china-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/">Trump’s Break With China Has Deadly Consequences</a></p>
<p>In November Americans will hopefully have the opportunity to decide whether to replace Trump as president and for that we not only need to assess how he and his administration handled this crisis, but also the ways in which he was responsible for it.</p>
<p>The isolationism he has been putting in place has contributed immensely to how bad COVID19 has been for the United States. As far as disease is concerned, imports and tariffs have nothing to do with it, rather it&rsquo;s about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html">the tremendous amount of global travel</a> that occurs every single day. Even if you restricted travel to China you can&rsquo;t stop the possibility of an American being in a conference room in Germany with a person who traveled there from China.</p>
<p>Isolationism does not work, that&rsquo;s the lesson the greatest generation learned and of which we are being reminded today. Let&rsquo;s heed the lessons well and revert to the wise decisions of prior administrations, Democrat and Republican.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been writing about the lessons we should learn from COVID-19, the biggest of which is that we are all connected such that a virus on the other side of the globe can find it&rsquo;s way to you in the United States. At the heart of this is putting our heads in the sand in the name of &ldquo;America First,&rdquo; which is the same mentality that existed prior to World War II and lead to World War II. As memories of the atrocities that occurred during during World War II fade we have been moving back in to an isolationist shell that puts all our lives in danger. Just because you don&rsquo;t like the implications of this does not mean ignoring will cause it to go away. It&rsquo;s time to wake up, put on our big boy and girl pants and deal with reality.</p>

And we’re barely cognizant as a global society that the world we’re living in today is fundamentally different than the world our species has ever lived in. You know that old saw that if you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will leap out. But if you take that same frog and put it in a pot of ambient water and slowly crank up the temperature, it will stay in that water and boil to death. It loses perspective on the changing environment around it. We’re that frog in the ambient water. We’re oblivious to the conditions that have enabled zoonotic viruses to become integrated into us.</p>

			 <p>The federal government’s response to COVID-19 makes total sense given that it’s currently lead by people who don’t believe in federal government. Another lesson we should learn from what we are going through is that there is a legitimate need for a federal government.</p>
<p>Right now your best chance at survival depends on how the governor of the state you live in is leading the response. It’s as if after Pearl Harbor we left it to the governor of Hawaii to deal with the response.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps the most important lesson we all should learn from COVID-19 is that we are all connected. Even something as small as a tiny virus on the otherside of the globe can affect you, and thus we can no longer think and act like we are on an island. You might not be sick, and you might not have COVID-19, but we all need you to stay home and do your part because what you do matters to everyone. If you truly believe that &ldquo;all lives matter&rdquo; now is the time to act on that belief.</p>

His view of the world in which everything negative is an attack on him personally prevented him from seizing an opportunity true leaders would have ran toward. You have had plenty opportunities to learn about the failures of leadership, such as how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George W.

			 <p>“What American pundits misunderstand when they brandish “market choice” as a weapon against social welfare, then, is that the social safety net does not extinguish human freedom but instead acts as its very condition of possibility (philosophers have called this the distinction between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom). <strong>Indeed, the best safeguard against the novel coronavirus is the ability to voluntarily withdraw oneself from capitalism.</strong> Therein lies the problem.”</p>
<p>Industries that employ hourly labor make up the majority of capitalism in the United States, and most of the jobs these people fill cannot be done from home. If these people don&rsquo;t get paid, they don&rsquo;t have the freedom to buy. One of the main reasons for the drops in the stock market is the decrease in consumption of items being sold, not because products cannot be produced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moment we no longer have a free press, anything can happen. What makes it possible for a totalitarian or any other dictatorship to rule is that people are not informed; how can you have an opinion if you are not informed? <strong>If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer.</strong> (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider for a moment why the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution restricts the U.S. Government from preventing a free press and from instituting a national religion. National religions and state run press were two tools of tyranny during the 17th and 18th centuries and why the founders felt important to retrict the U.S. Government access to those tools. Unfortunately, I think the far right has found a loophole to the process.</p>

			 <p>One addition I would make to <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes">the notes Dave wrote here</a> is that Trump and his entire administration must be held accountable to the consequences of their decisions that caused the slow and ineffective response that resulted in loss of life and damage to the economy. The Republicans will do everything and say everything to make sure Trump is not to blame. Only one Republican, Mitt Romney, appears willing to do what is right for the country rather than what is only right for themselves.</p>
<p>Also, note, the problem here isn&rsquo;t really with Trump, it&rsquo;s with the people in the Republican party who enabled Trump to win their primary and be elected. Unless Republicans, starting with Republican Senators, start to publicly stand up against Trump and LEAD, they should all be held accountable. It&rsquo;s time for Republicans to decided whether or not they are true Americans and true patriots. I so wish John McCain were still alive!</p>

<p>“In one study, Dominic Abrams and his colleagues divided groups of participants into smaller groups based on trivial categories (e.g., groups based on numbers that were randomly assigned to them). Then participants were asked to complete a difficult perceptual task while receiving helpful information from members of either their ingroup or outgroup. <strong>They found that participants did not rely on input from outgroup members even when it would have been useful for them to do so. Instead, they toiled on alone. Abrams and colleagues wrote, “[ Participants] resisted information purely on the basis that it was derived from a category of person to which they did not belong.””</strong> (Emphasis added)</p>

			 <p>“You don’t have to have scriptural or religious teaching. It’s just the truth: You can’t survive on your own. If you say you are going to be totally selfish, in next to no time the person who is totally selfish goes under. You need other people in order to be human. That’s why when they want to punish you they put you in solitary confinement. Because you can’t flourish without other human beings. They give you things that you cannot give yourself, no matter how much money you have. And so we speak of Ubuntu. A person is a person through other persons. And there must have been some people who said, ‘Ah, what a primitive way of thinking.’ It’s the most fundamental law of our being. We flout that—we flout it at our peril.”</p>

<p>On the surface, Roam looks like a cross between a slightly weird wiki and a note-taking tool like Evernote. It’s not. It implements a few key features of 1980s vintage hypertext visions — block-level addressability, transclusion (changes in referenced blocks being “transfer-included” wherever they are cited), and bidirectional linking — that utterly transform the writing experience at the finger-tips level.</p>

			 <p>There is a big gap in <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html#a183828">how the POTUS should be hired/elected</a> and how he or she is actually elected. One of the first questions I ask myself when determining who to vote for is whether the candidates are competent for the job. What qualifications do they have? Are they capable. In 2016 there was no doubt that Trump was not competent to be POTUS and that immediately disqualified him for the job, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Our country would be much better, I think, if all citizens first considered what are the skills for the job of POTUS and not what that person can do for them. Ultimately the skill is leadership, and leadership requires listening, compromise, persuasion, and humility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The French horn’s register plays in a higher range of the harmonic series (essentially, the notes that are naturally playable without the use of valves), compared to other brass instruments. At higher pitches, it is incredibly sensitive to even small changes in the position of the mouth and air volume. That’s one of the main causes of so many blunders, and the reason brass players joke that the best way to make a trombone sound like a French horn is to stuff your hand into the bell and miss all your notes.</p>

			 <p>“The American intellectuals who now find themselves alienated from the country that they inhabit aren’t interested in reality. They are interested in a fantasy nation, different and distinct from their own hateful country. America, with its complicated social and political as well as ethnic diversity, with its Constitution that ensures we will never, ever all be forced to feel as if “all life is focused in a central purpose”—this America no longer appeals to them at all.”</p>

			 <p>The main issue I have with the Democrat primary is that the candidate that I prefer is probably not the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, and I think removing Trump from office is the prime objective. Yet, the candidate that I prefer has a better chance of beating Trump than other candidates. Worse, I do not think Sanders is one of the candidates with the best chance of beating Trump. Still, the big question is whether all Democrats will unite behind whoever is the candidate. While Clinton did not campaign well enough to win in 2016, she was also hurt by Sanders supporters who refused to vote for her and that cannot happen this time or Trump wins re-election.</p>

Her injuries significantly cut into the amount of time she played competitive tennis, and no matter the amount of practice it is not the same as live matches. Top athletes maintain and excel their ability in competition and not just practice. Serena Williams' tournament success has been similarly impacted. It is practically impossible to win grand slam tournaments without playing in a good amount other tournaments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia’s influence campaign is driven by a desire to “watch us tear ourselves apart,” a senior FBI official said Monday, comments that come after details of a classified briefing to lawmakers became public in news reports, including a claim by the intelligence community’s top election security official that Moscow is interfering with the goal of helping President Donald Trump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely Russia learned how easy it has become to do this from our actions post 9-11. I think part of the problem is including that lede &ldquo;with the goal of helping President Donald Trump.&rdquo; Perhaps that is true, but the true goal is decreasing United States' standing in the world and elevating Putin&rsquo;s Russia, and that alone should be concerning to Trump and his supporters as much as everyone else. Republican refusal to do anything is pure negligence.</p>

			 <p>I think <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/20/144006.html?title=notesOnLastNightsDebate">we are hopelessly, intentionally fractured</a>, with factions obsessed with getting their way.  Consequently, there is no agreement about what&rsquo;s most important. Republicans are obsessed with keeping the guy with the R next to his name in the White House even if they don&rsquo;t like him. In their mind any Democrat will do more damage than Trump and anyone raising concerns about Trump are just partisan.</p>
<p>Democrats are NOT united on the priority to remove Trump, rather there appears to be a faction that seems to say, &ldquo;if extreme is the new norm then we have to nominate the most extreme person to win.&rdquo; It appears most Democrats have lost regard for moderates and independents. It&rsquo;s as if they learned the wrong lessons from 2016.</p>
<p>We really need a viable third party candidate; if only the current system wasn&rsquo;t rigged against that happening. Neither party seems really invested in the Constitution, and if you don&rsquo;t recognize Trump as a threat to the Constitution then you conclude he is no different than any other candidate.</p>

<p>We have an entire generation of Americans who have grown to adulthood since 9-11 and in those two decades they have never known a single moment when America was not at war. Three thousand Americans died on 9-11, and for that we have embarked on 20 years of revenge. 20 years. Tens, hundreds, of thousands dead as a result. We are trillions of dollars in debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, and the the whole article ought to be eye opening. One cannot claim themselves a patriot and not know of the documents and their purpose that founded the United States. Waving a flag doesn&rsquo;t matter, nor does supporting the military, nor standing during the national anthem, nor does reciting the pledge of allegiance if you know nothing about the Republic for which it stands!</p>

			 <p>One thing we have learned from the Trump presidency is that there aren&rsquo;t many true conservatives and they don&rsquo;t have any real power, just ideology. If the Executive Branch blatantly ignores the constitution through contempt of the judicial branch, do conservatives think that rises to the level of impeachment and removal? If they are true to &ldquo;conserving&rdquo; the Constitution they ought to otherwise what do they stand for, really?  Trump has already shown he thinks Congress has no authority over him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A weblog is a hierarchy of text, images, media objects and data, arranged chronologically, that can be viewed in an HTML browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will find many details about the components that make up a weblog, but to me the keys are chronology, usually reverse meaning most recent at the top of the page, voice, generally meaning written by a person, and brevity. The last is not something many consider but I think that good weblog posts are no more than three paragraphs long and I think there is a difference between an essay or a story and a weblog post. A story always has a title, a weblog post may or may not not have a title, and in fact most posts do not have a title.</p>
<p>What became confusing is when people and companies used weblog platforms as content management platforms to create and maintain web sites of an form and fashion and thus if a site were published by Wordpress it automatically was called a blog.</p>

<p>W. E. B. Du Bois predicted that, unless the United States met its obligations to the dignity and equality of all its citizens and ended its enthrallment to corporations, American democracy would fail: “If it is going to use this power to force the world into color prejudice and race antagonism; if it is going to use it to manufacture millionaires, increase the rule of wealth, and break down democratic government everywhere; if it is going increasingly to stand for reaction, fascism, white supremacy and imperialism; if it is going to promote war and not peace; then America will go the way of the Roman Empire.”</p>

I thought the problem was unique to the Microcell, but yesterday I was in a office where the phone only connected to a 4G network and then too the signal strength did not display.

<p>It is my belief that Steve Jobs views the iPad as an implementation of the iPhone Way to personal computing, and because that the iPhone Way is completely opposite to how we have always thought of personal computing, there are a lot of negative reviews of the iPad. You see arguments like “the iPad does not multitask (run mulitiple programs at the same time) so it is not a real computer,” or “the iPad does not have any USB ports to plug in hardware peripherals, so it is not a real computer.” I think both of these intentional design limitations were made to make the iPad simpler to use, because, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1529133/iworry-does-ipad-signal-end-era-open-computing?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+fastcompany/headlines+(Fast+Company+Headlines)">who is to say that our definition of personal computing today will be the same definition ten years from now</a>.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the Apple iPad announcement. Back on January 27, 2010 I wrote, &ldquo;<a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/27/has-apple-made-tablets-legit/">Has Apple Made Tablets Legit</a>?&rdquo; and the answer ten years later is a resounding yes. Personally, my iPads are my most used and most important personal computer. Ten years ago the iPad was limited enough to be viewed as a device one uses to read or watch videos, but the current iPads and now iPadOS paired with a keyboard and mouse make it capable of most forms of personal computing. There will always be situations and people demand nothing but a full notebook computer, and that is fine, as Steve Jobs said back then, one can still drive a truck. Happy belated birthday iPad!</p>
<p>P.S. Reading my <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/29/drinking-from-the-ipad-firehose/">past writing</a> on this <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/30/the-iphone-way/">topic</a>, I realize that embedded in the iPad was Apple&rsquo;s transition to designing their own processors, with their first included in that iPad.</p>
<p>P.S.S. I find it really cool that I can look back and read what I wrote ten years ago. Of course, that only happens because I am paying the bill to continue hosting my old blog. This December I will have been blogging for 21 years.</p>

			 <p>Last week I participated in <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2020/01/20/mobileviews-podcast-314-guests-frank-mcpherson-chris-spera/">the MobileViews podcast</a> and in it we talked about foldable screen devices. I stated my opinion that we ought to think of them as foldable tablets rather than foldable phones. In other words, are there use cases in which we wish we could use a tablet but it&rsquo;s too large to carry around? I think this is important positioning because most people are going to think smartphones are small enough, and foldables are really about making a large screen surface smaller. Coincidentally Microsoft released their SDK for Duo, which is there planned foldable smartphone that they announced last October. The Verge has taken a look at the SDK and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/23/21077846/microsoft-software-sdk-duo-android-phone-pragmatism">explained how that translates to the user experience</a> and I agree it sounds like Microsoft has the right approach. I do wonder, though, about how many cases where users wish they could see Android apps side by side because that appears to be one of the cases Duo will be well suited.</p>

The bug was introduced to the U.S. government by Ronald Reagan. The bug is thinking that compromise and changing one&rsquo;s mind is wrong. Reality is that compromise and changing one&rsquo;s mind is wisdom, which we sorely lack. The root cause of the bug is thinking of the President of the United States as a dictator. You see this clearly in Trump&rsquo;s actions and in his words: &ldquo;Only I can do it.!&rdquo; In the Republic formed by the United States Constitution governing involves compromise and convincing people to change their minds. By design one person can NOT change our government. It&rsquo;s on purpose, and I do not think one can claim themselves a patroit of the United States without embracing this understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My observation of the managers I work for is that when they talk about &ldquo;growth&rdquo; they mean financial (revenue and profit) growth, not at all what is described in this article. Perhaps that is a difference between managers and leaders?</p>

			 <p><a href="https://blog.armory.io/netflix-doesnt-hire-the-best-engineers-they-create-them/">Netflix doesn’t hire the best engineers. They create them.</a></p>
<p>I hired in to a company that believed this and had the culture to back it. Over time as leaders left and MBAs took over creating the best engineers was deemed too expensive and with that the culture deteriorated to the point where today it is worse than non existent. Corporate America lots of managers making lots of money running corporations and very few true leaders.</p>
<p>For me the money quote is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When speaking to engineer leaders we bring up the story about the Netflix engineer above. We do this to emphasize the importance of the environment they are creating. “Creating,” being the operative word here. Environments don’t just happen, they are created through action.</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s inability to do so is the prime reason why he should have never been elected nor should be re-elected. It&rsquo;s simple really, either we live under the rule of law established by the Constitution, meaning we have a republic, or we don&rsquo;t meaning we have a dictatorship.</p>

<p>Remember when new phones were announced at CES? Hard to believe this was 11 years ago. Reading the article, I think it was a good analysis on my part. The functionality of Synergy has in most ways been integrated into iOS and Android, but ironically the wireless charging that Touchstone had is still not pervasive. My bottom line proved correct, Palm could not get developers to write apps, they were already occupied with iOS and Android. Palm would flounder until being eventually bought by my then employer, Hewlett Packard.</p>
<p>I stand by my opinion that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">WebOS</a> is the best tablet operating system that I have ever used. If you think of it, ChromeOS is in many ways an iteration of WebOS except that it was keyboard first and thus still struggling in a tablet format.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2019/11/24/mobileviews-podcast-308-raspberry-pi-as-an-ipad-accessory-macbook-pro-thoughts-and-more/">episode 308</a> of the MobileViews podcast Jon Westfall talked about <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/">a blog post</a> describing how to configure a Raspberry Pi 4 as a USB-C accessory for the iPad Pro. The instructions configure the Pi so that you connect an iPad to the Pi using a USB-C cable. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6sDcKo3V8">A video</a> is also available that provides step-by-step instructions, and you can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSlyqo5Q2Q">another video</a> in which the author answers questions that were left in the comments of the original video.</p>
<p>While I found the concept intriguing there is no way I could implement it because it only works if you have the latest iPad Pro that has a USB-C port, which I do not have.</p>
<p>Later I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbvSS8MJm2s">another video</a> done by the author of the original one showing how to install an application called <a href="https://raspap.com/">RaspAP</a> and configure it to be a WiFi hotspot AND a WiFi client at the same time. With this configuration you can connect any iPad, or any other device that has WiFi and then you can SSH in to the Pi from the iPad to have access to a Linux command prompt, from which you could run a number of different applications, programming environments, and utilities.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually not too difficult to configure a Raspberry Pi as a WiFi hotspot (access point) and I actually had done so to a small Raspberry Pi Zero W that I have been using as a portable backup for a wiki I maintain of home information. The problem with how I have been using the Pi Zero is that it can only be either a WiFi access point OR a WiFi client, so when configured as an access point the Pi Zero can&rsquo;t connect to my home network or the Internet.</p>
<p>What makes RaspAP better is that it configures a Raspberry Pi so that it can be an access point AND WiFi client at the same time using the same wlan port! I am not sure how this is done because as you may know a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; WiFi access point must have a second wired Ethernet connection to connect to a cable modem and provide Internet access, in such instances the access point routes (or bridges) network traffic between two networks (different IP addressing), one being the WiFi network and the other being the wired network, each requiring one port.</p>
<p>The installation of RaspAP does require connecting the Raspberry Pi to a wired network connection because there is a step that requires resetting the wlan0 interface that will hang if the port is in use. However, after installation, the Pi will connect to your home network and act as an access point for another network at the same time.</p>
<p>Along the way I also found out that I can power the Raspberry Pi 3b+ using the Ravpower  (Model RP-PB043) portable battery that I own, which means that I have a portable, wireless network between an iPad and and a Linux computer that will work anywhere.</p>
<p>How might I use this set up?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I am working on a Nodejs program. I can have Nodejs installed on the Raspberry Pi and I can have all my code also on that Pi, perhaps cloned from a git repo. Let&rsquo;s say I plan to be on a long flight and I want to carry a minimal amount of gear. I can pack my iPad Pro, Raspberry Pi, and the Ravpower in my carry on and when I am able, power up the Pi, leave it in the carry on, and connect to it via WiFi from the iPad. At this point I can then SSH into the Pi and use a text editor (emacs, nano, etc..) to work on my code and test it using nodejs. Of course, you can do this for any other programming environments or compilers that install on the Raspberry Pi and run via the command prompt. (Actually.. one should also be able to VNC into the graphical Raspbarian environment if you need to.)</p>
<p>While I could do the above via the airplane WiFi, doing so costs money and service can be spotty, this network connectivity once configured is available nearly the same way all the time. The &ldquo;remote programmer&rdquo; scenario is just one idea off the top of my head, I am sure there are other uses cases for a configuration such as this. The developer of RaspAP is working to include OpenVPN to make the Pi a VPN endpoint that will provide all secured network communication for all devices that connect to it. You can find more examples for using RaspAP <a href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-awesome">in this Github repo</a>.</p>

<p>“If the President has been willing to withhold foreign military assistance to secure campaign help, how could Americans trust him when he launched a military strike against another country? Was Solemani&rsquo;s killing done in the national interest or in Trump&rsquo;s self-interest? Did the President create serious instability for his own needs, possibly even in an effort to divert public attention from the impeachment.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President Trump lies and this is not even disputed by most of his supporters, they just claim he is no different than Obama or any other past president. So, given that we all accept that he lies, how can we trust anything he or his administration says? If we are to go back in to war again, should we not be sure it&rsquo;s for legitimate reasons? If you are a patriot and support our military who puts their life on the line then you should demand the risk of their sacrifice is in support of the interests of the United States and not just the President of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even as the U.S. economy hums along at a favorable pace, there is a vast segment of workers today earning wages low enough to leave their livelihood and families extremely vulnerable. That’s one of the main takeaways from our new analysis, in which we found that 53 million Americans between the ages of 18 to 64—accounting for 44% of all workers—qualify as “low-wage.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current economy is not about employment and it&rsquo;s certainly not about the stock market, it&rsquo;s about wages. Employers do not want to increase wages or provide full time employment.</p>
<p>Candidates for POTUS need to properly identify the problem, talk about whether the current course we are on, which seems targeted at tariffs, is really going to solve the problem, and if not propose solutions.</p>
<p>Note that getting &ldquo;the 1%&rdquo; to pay their share of taxes is NOT going to solve the problem of low income jobs.</p>

			 <p>My wish for 2020, a year that ought to be one of re-visioning (see with new/clear eyes), is that citizens of the United States learned <a href="https://constitutionus.com/">the U.S. Constitution</a>. The Constitution established a new government designed to <strong>contain power</strong> rather than <strong>provide power</strong>. To be truly patriotic is to be vigilant against re-interpretation of the Constitution as power establishing. Tyranny will not come to the United States via tanks, machine guns or bullets, it will emerge after patiently waiting for people to forget what tyranny really means.</p>

<p>This is a great story about the Atari personal computers. I bought an Atari 800XL when I was in college and used it along with a VT-100 terminal emulator to write programs for my computer science classes in the late 80s. (Back then most of our programming was done on mainframes and we only really needed a terminal.) After being hired out of college I &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; to an Atari 1040ST, which had a GUI similar to the Mac but cost much less. I will always think fondly of Atari due to its role in my early personal computer days.</p>

An Implementation Status table on <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">the Indieweb Micropub clients page</a> suggests the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is that micro.blog does not support/expose the delete, undelete, or update actions; the only action it appears you can do from a Micropub client is create.</p>

			 <p>Today <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html">Dave Winer writes</a> about simplicity of blogging, what he describes as Flow. The idea is to make writing a new blog post as frictionless as possible.</p>
<p>For me it very quick to write and publish a new blog post, I click the <a href="https://omnibear.com/">OmniBear</a> icon on the Chrome toolbar, write in Content field, and click Post. Boom, I have a new post on my blog.</p>
<p>However, <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html#a154653">what happens next</a> is a problem. To edit a post I have to go to the micro.blog site and click through many steps rather than see a simple Edit link on the post or the ability to open the post to edit in Bear.</p>
<p>Editing appears to be a weakness of <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">micropub</a>, most likely because its origin is tied to Twitter which has no concept of editing. We need better ways to originate and edit blog posts.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/plans/">Comcast&rsquo;s 1024 GB (1 TB) monthly data plan</a> (data cap) does not provide enough data for an increasing number of people. The main reason is that an increasing number of services, like Netflix, are streaming video at 4K quality, and in the case of Netflix, it default is to stream at the highest quality. Comcast and I fundamentally disagree, in that <a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/">Comcast says few people will actually be affected</a> by the data cap.</p>
<p>Last week I was shocked when I received an email notice from Comcast that we had consumed 90% of our 1024 data for the month. Why does Comcast default the notification to 90% rather than 50%? The higher data consumption appears to coincide with an automatic and &ldquo;free&rdquo; increase of our bandwidth to 100 Mbps last month. Comcast says an increase in bandwidth does not automatically lead to increase data usage, but given that Netflix, and I assume other apps, default to the highest quality video I suspect we ended up viewing more 4K video this month than we have in the past.</p>
<p>Ever since receiving the email notification I have been closely monitoring our data usage, comparing network traffic stats to Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter, and I think the usage meter is accurate, unlike an issue that occurred in October where the meter was wrongly indicating drastically higher consumption. In general, I think Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter is insufficient in that it only shows a monthly total. If you have a cap and will automatically charge overages, I think you must at least provide daily stats. The worst part is that home owners don&rsquo;t have a good or easy to use tools of their own to confirm Comcast&rsquo;s data, leaving consumers at a disadvantage when trying to dispute Comcast&rsquo;s data.</p>
<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/estimator/">Comcast&rsquo;s Usage Estimate calculator</a> says a HD stream consumes 1.7 GB of data per hour, where as Netflix says that 1 hour of HD consumes 3 GB. Comcast and Netflix agree that one hour of 4K video consumes around 8 GB per hour. Using Netflix&rsquo;s rate that HD consumes 3 GB per hour, Comcast&rsquo;s claim that you can stream 21 GB per day of HD video is not correct. At 3 GB per hour, that&rsquo;s 11 hours per day for 1024 GB per month.</p>
<p>Last night I watched 1 hour of CW Seed on my Apple TV that consumed 6 GB of data, suggesting to me that stream is UHD quality rather than HD and I don&rsquo;t see a way to control the quality in the CW Seed app.</p>
<p>If you only have one video stream in a house, 11 hours is probably enough, but if you increase that to two streams, you are down to 5 hours per day per stream and that is not hard to exceed, particularly if you unknowingly watch some video in 4K. If you stream all video at 4K you can only watch a little over 4 hours per day, which is tight for one stream, and impossible for two.</p>
<p>You can control the quality of the video streams for some services, but you have to do so per application/service. For example, you can <a href="https://ipstarbroadband.com.au/support/how-to-reduce-netflix-data-usage/">configure Netflix to only stream at Standard quality</a>, but who wants to do that if they spent money on a HD TV? And, if you use more than one app, as many do with say Disney+ or Amazon Prime, you might not be able to change the video quality or you will have to spend a lot of time changing settings in indivdiual apps. And again&hellip; you spent good money on a high quality TV, you rightly expect to be able to see the best video!</p>
<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/unlimited/">Comcast does provide an unlimited plan</a> for an additional $50 per month. The current cap appears intended to drive more, if not most, home owners to pay that $50 more per month. (I personally don&rsquo;t do online gaming, but I bet that can consume a significant amount of data per month). In my case, Comcast kindly increased our bandwidth to 100 Mbps at no additional cost&hellip;. but that&rsquo;s not entirely true since I now appear to be in the position of having to pay $50 more per month!</p>

			 <p>I continue to monitor <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/internet-data-consumption">my home Internet data usage</a> closely since receiving notice from Comcast that we are near the 1024 GB monthly cap. I enabled Traffic Stats on my home router so that I can compare that to Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter. Traffic stats is an approximation because it doesn&rsquo;t only show traffic coming in from the Internet but also traffic within my home network, but I think it can give me an indication of whether Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter is accurate. (If caps are going to be a thing, Home Routers need a feature that shows download and upload traffic to the Internet.)</p>
<p>After the first day, it seems the Comcast usage meter is accurate. If that is true, somehow we doubled our Internet data usage and the only thing I know changed is that our bandwidth jumped to 100 Mbps in the last month. The usage meter only shows data going back to June, so it looks to me like Comcast just started enforcing this data cap in our area, probably coinciding with the increase to 100 Mbps. Something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, my usage as around 775 GB per month and with no other change other than the bandwidth increase I don&rsquo;t know what we have been doing differently. It&rsquo;s as if Netflix detected I have more bandwidth and decided on its own to use it and I don&rsquo;t see an option to throttle it back to 1080 or 720.</p>
<p>The data cap is annoying, and frankly I think the lack in detail in Comcast&rsquo;s reporting is a problem that needs to be addressed by regulation. If you have a cap you can&rsquo;t just report a monthly total, I think you have to at least show daily usage. Given that increase in streaming providers supporting 4K video, 1024 GB (1 TB) per month is really not enough.</p>
<p>Comcast will be happy to remove the cap if I pay them $50 more per month. I will probably end up paying that for the benefit of not needing to constantly monitor data usage.</p>

We ought to have substantive conversation about what is America and how it might be great, but we don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Here is a problem, greatness is not something one can self-declare. My constantly saying that I am great does not make me so, that makes me arrogant. Greatness is only determined by people other than oneself, and the same is true for countries. This is something Americans don&rsquo;t seem to understand, but it is a truth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think most people add the words &ldquo;for me&rdquo; to the end of MAGA, which ironically is the exact opposite to <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/documents/ask-not.htm">a quote from a Democrat President, John F. Kennedy</a>. A quote that frankly conservatives should recognize as their own rather than a liberal&rsquo;s. Please think about that when you complain about entitlement.</p>
<p>We ought to aspire to greatness, but that aspiration needs to be framed in the understanding of how greatness is truly determined.</p>

			 <p>Today I received an email from Comcast informing me that we have consumed 90% of our 1 TB data alotment for the month. While I had been vaguely aware that <a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/faq/">Comcast has data caps</a>, I had not encountered an issue with it until today.</p>
<p>What I find odd is that we have been averaging about 650 GB of data per month, and now mid-month Comcast is saying we have already consumed about 900 GB? What changed? Frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I noticed that mid last month our Internet download speed increased from around 70 mbps to 100 mbps. There seems to be a relationship between the increase in our bandwidth and how much Comcast claims we are now using. I didn&rsquo;t ask for the bandwidth increase. I am wondering whether now that our speed is faster the streaming services we use have flipped over to higher data rate video streaming than we&rsquo;ve been using previously?</p>
<p>What is frustrating is that the data usage meter Comcast provides is just a total consumption per month, it doesn&rsquo;t show me a per day or even per week breakdown. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know how I have any way to confirm that what Comcast is claiming I am consuming is what I am actually using!</p>
<p>Comcast provides 2 months of &ldquo;free&rdquo; data overage before they will start charging me $10 for each 50 GB we go over the cap per month, so I don&rsquo;t have to do anything drastic right now. Right now I don&rsquo;t even know how to begin to fight this thing, I am going to have to study the topic and see if there is something that I can implement on my end to show how much data we actually do consume per month.</p>

			 <p>I needed to buy a new smartphone this week that I did not want to spend much money on because I really just needed it to handle phone calls and text messages, so I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV/">this Nokia 6</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my first phone from the new Nokia and I have to say that I am really impressed. Solid construction with a very nice display. Best of all so far is the Battery life&hellip; it&rsquo;s been running for more than 30 hours since I charged it and still has 40% left&hellip; although I don&rsquo;t have many apps (particularly apps like Facebook) installed, so that may be a contributor.</p>
<p>A bonus with this phone is that it is dual SIM, unlocked and it can also use a SD card, although if you do you cannot use the second SIM as it uses the same slot.</p>
<p>While the phone ships with Android 7.1.1. installed it upgraded to Android 9 immediately upon set up. It is stock Android with only an FM Radio and My Phone apps added to the standard apps you find with Android.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this phone will upgrade to Android 10 and Google may not be pushing security updates for Androids 9, but I have found this to be a great phone for the price!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/12/11/does-not-look.html">Earlier this week</a> we learned that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chat</a> was generally available to Android users, and at the time it did not look to me like it was working with AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>As it happened, I set up a new phone on AT&amp;T this week and I was surprised to find that when I started Messages I saw a message saying Chat messaging was available. I then went in to Google Play and saw that the Carrier Services app was installed on the phone.</p>
<p>I still didn&rsquo;t see the feature available on my Pixel 2, however, so I thought, what if I searched for Carrier Services in Google Play and tried to install it? Turns out that I found it and was able to install it and after that the Chat services connected and was functional.</p>
<p>I now have two phones with the feature enabled, which allows me to test it. You will know if you are using chat if you see &ldquo;Chat message&rdquo; displayed in the input box, otherwise you see &ldquo;Text message&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I find the chat functions similar to Facebook Messenger. If you are chatting back and forth you see the &hellip; indicating a response is being typed. The messages and pictures appear near instantly.</p>
<p>BTW, the two phones I have are on Android 10 and 9, so I know at least one generation older than the current will be able to use the service. I am looking forward to seeing whether/how soon my friends get the service.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s odd that the service is intended for Notes and Lists, indicating it was probably original conceived for integration with Keep. With it configured to work with Any.do, it doesn&rsquo;t appear as though I can create and store notes. I don&rsquo;t doubt that I could create notes if I set it up with Keep.</p>

			 <p>Today electing a president is not about issues, nor is it about changing minds, nor is it about who looks better and sounds better of TV. The election is not about a personal popularity contest. Electing a president is now simply about opposition. In short, there is no middle ground just as the middle class has grown increasingly small.</p>
<p>If you identify Republican you are likely going to only vote for Republicans because you think all Democrats are crazy and will destroy the country. Likewise, if you identify Democrat you will only vote Democrat. If you really don&rsquo;t like your candidate you will not vote, or write in Mickey Mouse rather than cast a vote for the opposing party.</p>
<p>The consequence is that the candidates only say what their &ldquo;base&rdquo; wants to  hear, and it doesn&rsquo;t even matter of what is said is true. Candidates don&rsquo;t really try to change people&rsquo;s minds. In this environment, do we really need debates?  Worse, there is little for few remaing, truly &ldquo;independent&rdquo; voters to hear, and frankly doing a bunch of research is too much work for the average voter. Increasing numbers of these disenfranchised voters will simply sit out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think Democrats think the lesson learned from 2016 is to focus on their base and ignore the middle because they think there are more liberal/progressives voters than conservative, Republicans, or independents. An extreme shift left is viewed by their opposition as further evidence of crazy Democrats.</p>
<p>The authors of the U.S. Constitution foresaw this type of fanaticism that democracy enables and thus created a structure to prevent it. Unfortunately, over time political idealogies have trumped preservation of the Republic concentrating more power within the Presidency. A party aligned, rubber stamping Congress and Supreme Court is a defacto dictatorship and this is effectly today&rsquo;s U.S. government.</p>

			 <p>Upon further review it looks like my Pixel 2 doesn&rsquo;t know how to display the signal strength when the phone connects to the AT&amp;T Microcell in our home. When I leave the house it displays fine, but when I come back and it connects to the Microcell I actually see it show all bars and then the bars disappear. Perhaps it&rsquo;s due to the fact that the microcell only provides 3G data, which I don&rsquo;t care about because I use WiFi for data at home. In the the number of bars don&rsquo;t really matter so long as my call connections work and don&rsquo;t drop, but it&rsquo;s annoying.</p>

			 <p>One thing I don&rsquo;t understand is why people don&rsquo;t get that Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat. When he is not running for President Bernie has an I by his name, and frankly I see him as using the party. It is fair to say Bernie is a Progressive, but that does not necessarily make him a Democrat. If people thought about it, they would also realize that a person who considers themself a Conservative does not necessarily mean they are a Republican, nor should one assume that a person calls themself a Republican that means they are a Conservative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They offer us something much better, an entirely different way of knowing: an intimate relationship, a dark journey, a path where we must discover for ourselves that grace, love, mercy, and forgiveness are absolutely necessary for survival in an uncertain world. You only need enough clarity to know how to live without certitude! Yes, we really are saved by faith. People who live in this way never stop growing, are not easily defeated, are wise and compassionate, and frankly, are fun to live with. They have a quiet and confident joy. Infantile religion insists on certainty every step of the way and thus is not very happy.</p>

<p>A nice thing about Chrome OS is that it enables to to work with folders in Google Drive as if they are locally on your computer. By default PDFs open in a Chrome tab and you can create a bookmark but the URL is unique to Chrome OS and will not work on other platforms, so I created a &ldquo;From Pixelbook&rdquo; folder in Chrome bookmarks and put these bookmark there.</p>

			 <p>While listening to <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2019/11/24/mobileviews-podcast-308-raspberry-pi-as-an-ipad-accessory-macbook-pro-thoughts-and-more/">the latest MobileViews Podcast</a> I heard Jon Westfall describe using the Raspberry Pi 4 as an accessory to an iPad Pro. The key component of the solution is the USB-C ports on the iPad Pro and the Raspberry Pi 4 because they are used to power the Raspberry Pi and provide network communication between the iPad and the Raspberry Pi. I am surprised that the iPad&rsquo;s USB-C power output meets the Pi 4&rsquo;s higher power input requirements, however I learned that the latest firmware upgrade for the Pi 4 includes a low power option along with Ethernet over USB, which are  key for this working.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://youtu.be/IR6sDcKo3V8">a YouTube video</a> that shows the configuration and a link to <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/">a web page</a> that provides more details about the configuration.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Raspberry Pi Zero W in a similar manner except that I power it using USB battery and access it via WiFi when the Pi Zero is configured as a wireless access point. The result provides me access to Linux terminal apps but does not provide simultaneous access to the Internet.</p>
<p>I like the idea of using the Raspberry Pi 4 as described, but in my case I would need to buy a new iPad Pro with the USB-C port. Capabilities such of this do make the idea of upgrading to the latest iPad Pros more compelling.</p>

			 <p>I bought <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/raspberry-pi-4">the Raspberry Pi4</a> this past week and I&rsquo;ve installed it in a <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">Flirc Raspberry Pi4</a> case. Beside the fact that the Flirc case looks really nice, the case provides passive cooling of the CPU. Reviews of the Pi4 when it first released indicated it ran hot enough under load to hit the 82&rsquo;C threshold that causes the CPU speed to throttle down. The Raspberry Pi Foundation as released a firmware update that improves cooling and so far with the firmware and the Flirc case the top temp I&rsquo;ve seen is 44&rsquo;C.</p>
<p>The reason why the Raspberry Pi4 runs hotter is that it has a faster ARM Cortex-A72 CPU processor, as much as 4 GB of RAM, and a USB-C power supply. I am using daenerys (my name for this computer) to type this post and I am finding it surprisingly useful for web applications. Gmail, with its heavy use of Javascript is unbearable in older models, but is actually usable on the Pi4.</p>
<p>For a little under $100, the Pi4 is defintely worth being a child&rsquo;s first computer. I think it can also be a very servicable Linux server, running Raspbian Buster Lite, a variant of Debian Buster, for home projects.</p>
<p>Right now I don&rsquo;t any plans for daenerys but I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes open for any opportunities. Daenerys is my fifth Raspberry Pi. The first model I bought was the Pi2, which I have connected to a seven inch screen and serves a desk clock that shows my schedule, CNN newsfeed, current weather, and four day weather forcase. I have a Pi3 running Tiddlyserver that I am using to for a family wiki, and another running Taiga, which is a project management app. I also have a Pi Zero W that use to host a portable copy of the family wiki.</p>

			 <p>“In the 1700s, philosophers like John Locke argued that public life and politics should be separated from gratitude. Civic relations should be based on rules and laws—not gifts, favors, or quid pro quo—with the participation and consent of the governed. Private life, philosophers suggested, could still be ordered by gifts and gratitude in the more limited arenas of families and friends. <strong>Thus, constitutions eventually replaced kingly rulers, and laws distributed political benefits through the will of the people.</strong>”  (emphasis mine)</p>

			 <p>“The emperor or king gave his subjects the “gifts” of protection and provision. In return, subjects offered loyalty, homage, service, tithes, and taxes. If you failed to return the ruler’s favor—such as not paying a tribute or refusing to send your son to serve in the army—you were branded an “ingrate.” Ingratitude was disloyalty and sometimes treason, crimes punishable by denial of favor, reduction in rank, seizure of property, enslavement, prison, exile, or death.”</p>

			 <p>President Trump simply believes that he as president cannot commit a crime. He believes that a president is above the law. Trump&rsquo;s belief is the logical conclusion of decades of expansion of presidential powers that started with Vietnam.</p>
<p>How far have we fallen? At the beginning of my life President Nixon resigned before he was impeached because he broke the law. Nixon knew he would be impeached because he knew and accepted that Americans did not believe a President was above the law. We now have President Trump who believes that more Americans now accept that a President is above the law and believes that Americans today find loyalty to him and loyalty to party more important than loyalty to the Republic.</p>
<p>All presidents in my life time have desired more power. The real problem has been Congress' abdication of it&rsquo;s prime constitutional responsibility to be a check on the presidency. At root of this abdication is the transformation of Congress as representative of all U.S. citizens to only representative of the majority party. Rather than upholding and defending the U.S. Constitution, Congress has become all about enabling and implementing a Republican or Democrat ideology.</p>
<p>What I find ironic is that I think the core belief of conservatism is that &ldquo;abosolute power corrupts absolutely&rdquo; and yet Republican conservatives have been the prime architects of the expansion of powers to the president. Conservatives should be truly republican but do not act like it, but rather tend to act more as anarchists.</p>
<p>Worst of all is that too many U.S. citizens do not care that this is happening! Too many people do not know the Constitution nor appreciate the fundamental reasons for why the U.S. form of republican democracy was designed and adopted. These people pledge allegiance to a flag <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/no-brainer-trump-tweets-support-for-amendment-banning-flag-burning-1.586168">as if the flag is the thing</a> rather than a symbol of the real thing, our way of life enabled by the Constitution.</p>
<p>What has been taking place over the course of my life time is the ascendency of a U.S. monarchy or dictatorship under the veneer of the Presidency. If you are truly a U.S. patriot your loyalty should be to the &ldquo;Republic for which it stands&rdquo;, which means the Constitution that defines the republic.</p>

<p>The emoluments clause, also called the foreign emoluments clause, is a provision of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 8) that generally prohibits federal officeholders from receiving any gift, payment, or other thing of value from a foreign state or its rulers, officers, or representatives.</p>
<p>The plain purpose of the foreign emoluments clause was to ensure that the country’s leaders would not be improperly influenced, even unconsciously, through gift giving, then a common and generally corrupt practice among European rulers and diplomats.</p>

			 <p>“The worst cost of factions comes when they capture the state for rent-seeking—for the purpose of directing the state’s power for the benefit of themselves, and for the exploitation and even the oppression of others. But because this problem is “sown” in human nature, which is permanent, so, too, is the problem. Hence there can be no end—no conceivable end—to the need to limit government by circumscribing its powers that can be captured by factions. This is true even—actually, especially—when the power of the state is wielded in response to a majority faction.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been the general American practice regarding criminal law to grant considerable discretion to prosecutors, so that by analogy one could argue that the House has complete discretion to decide whether to initiate impeachment proceedings. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist No. 77, argued that the nation would find &ldquo;republican&rdquo; safety from a presidential abuse of power by the mode of his election and by his &ldquo;being at all times liable to impeachment.&rdquo; There is no doubt that the Framers saw impeachment as a part of the system of checks and balances to maintain the separation of powers and the republican form of government. <strong>The implication is that when the President (or other impeachable official) has committed an impeachable offense, the Members of the House, bound by the oaths they take to uphold the Constitution, are under a particular obligation to deal with the miscreant&rsquo;s offenses, irrespective of whether their bill of impeachment may or may not lead to a conviction in the Senate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely, this is why a Republican-led House initiated impeachment proceedings on Bill Clinton. Why should the current Democrat-led House not be bound to the same obligation to hold proceedings on President Trump.</p>

			 <p>I watched <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/microsoftevent">the 2019 Microsoft Surface event</a> and I have to admit that I like what I saw of the Surface Neo and Duo. Microsoft has basically taken the concept of using two desktop computer monitors to a mobile device, the question is whether that works with large or small screens. I also wonder about their durability, but we have had foldback screens on notebook PCs for a long time now, so that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>
<p>I also think <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview">the Surface Pro X</a> looks very nice, I can see it as a decent competitor to the iPad Pro, but the $999 starting price is too high. My reaction first reaction to it is that it looks like what the Google Pixel Slate should have been.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that despite Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud first/mobile first strategy, they are developing some really nice looking hardware.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel">achilles' heel</a> of the U.S. Constitution are political parties. The model of government the U.S. Constitution established was designed to forge a republic of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; from southern and northern states, within the context of slavery. The Constitution was not written to address and mitigate the power of political parties and thus I see the possibility of a constitutionally enabled dictatorship.</p>
<p>How would a constitutionally enabled dictatorship look like? First, you neuter the electoral college. Next, you remove all power from the minority party in Congress. Next, you have 60% of the U.S. Senate made up of party of the President and more than half of the House also the same party as the President. Finally, you have all Supreme Court justices of the same party as the president. All three branches align to one party and then Congress and the Supreme Court do nothing more than rubber stamp anything the President requests and you have in place a dictatorship.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is not supposed to be political but it now totally is ever since the Reagan administration.</p>
<p>The Congress is supposed to be the primary means of checks and balances but that too has turned into nothing more than alignment with the President since Vietnam.</p>
<p>The fourth estate, the press, is now corporately owned and no longer fulfills its defacto role in government given to it by the first amendment.</p>
<p>And finally, we seem to no longer really have U.S. Citizens, instead we are people who see themselves as Conservative or Liberal, Republican or Democrat.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a civil war. Democracy in the U.S. will fail without a single shot fired no matter the interpretation of the second amendment.</p>

In a world where people both have too high and too low expectations for professional sport coaches and managers, the common playbook front offices take when teams under-perform is to fire the manager.</p>
<p>Yes, change is needed, and yes, it is easier to fire one person, the manager, and not the team. But, Maddon is not the reason why the Cubs did not make the playoffs. First, and foremost the reason is that Cub players did not do their job. The same players who once ground out at bats in 2016 where doing nothing more than swing for the fences all this year. Second, the Cubs lineup is nothing but the same style hitter, with no diversity on the bench or apparently in the farm system, and the talent, that&rsquo;s on the Theo Epstein and the front office.</p>
<p>Frankly, up until this point, what Epstein and the front office have done is succeed with the easy decisions and fail at the hard decisions. How hard is it to tank year after year and stock pile on draft picks that every talent scout in America says is a good bet? When Maddon became available, was it really hard to quickly decide to drop Ricky Renteria and sign Maddon?</p>
<p>Be careful for what you ask for, you just might get it. Now Epstein has to make one of the most important decisions of his tenure, who to hire to replace the manager that guided your team to the first World Series in 108 years. David Ross might be a good guy in the clubhouse, but will he have the players attention any more than Maddon? Will Joe Girardi be too hard? Who Epstein hires is crucial towards getting the most out of all the the talented players that are now starting to enter the end of their contracts.</p>
<p>Worse of all, the attention on hiring the next manager redirects attention away from the real heavy lifting of the offseason, which is to make changes to the lineup so that you get more professional at bats. Changing the lineup means moving one of the core players who won the World Series, which is something Epstein has refused to do to date. If you only replace the manager and keep everything else the same, why should we expect a different result?</p>
<p>On Saturday Epstein announced that Maddon will not be returning. If next year is no better, who will be the scapegoat then? You can&rsquo;t fire the entire team.</p>

			 <p>The common denominator for all my favorite professional sports teams is that they were losers during my childhood. The Green Bay Packers were the siberia of the NFL during the 70s and 80s until Reggie White started playing for them in 1993 and three years later won the Super Bowl. Ever since 1993 the Packers have been at or near the top of the NFL.</p>
<p>The Chicago Cubs were the epitome of &ldquo;lovable losers&rdquo; for a century. Even though the Cubs flirted with chances to make it to the World Series in 1984, 1989, and 2003 but it hasn&rsquo;t been until the last five years that they have consistently been at or near the top of the league, and you know they won it all in 2016.</p>
<p>Like the Green Bay Packers, the Detroit Red Wings were also once the dominant team in the NHL but during the 70s and 80s they were known as the &ldquo;dead Wings.&rdquo; The owners had to give away cars to get people to come to their games. In 1997 the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup, and of my favorite teams they have won more championships in my life time, winning again in 1998, 2002, and 2008. Since the calendar turned to the 2010s the Wings have been in a rebuilding phase.</p>
<p>Finally, the Detroit Pistons where also perenial losers during my childhood but where the first of my faves that I witnessed winning a championship in 1989, and again in 1990 and 2004. Frankly, the championship they won in 2004 is one of the most gratifying because nobody really expected it and they upset the perenial champion Los Angeles Lakers. Like the Red Wings, the Pistons are rebuilding but apppear to be nearing returning to the tops of their league sooner than the Wings.</p>
<p>Over my life time I&rsquo;ve seen the long road it takes to get from basement to top floor of a professional sports league. I&rsquo;ve seen how it takes for a team to learn how to be a champion, particularly from the Red Wings who had huge playoff failures after being the best team in their league the entire season.</p>
<p>Of all my favorite teams, the Cubs have the most talent and I expect will have chances to win championships again in the foreseeable future. The MLB&rsquo;s farm system enables a franchise to have more control over its future if they have the right leadership. The NHL is similar, which is why theirs and the MLB front offices have such a huge influence on their long term success, much more than in the NFL and NBA that seems to depend much more on health and luck.</p>
<p>I am dissappointed that the Chicago Cubs will not make the playoffs this year. I will always love the Cubbies, win or lose, but I much better like where they are now, a very good team that can disappoint than a bad team that surprises.</p>

			 <p>I watched the Apple iPhone event this afternoon and found all the emphasis on the cameras to be over the top. I know that Google has received praise for the cameras in the Pixels so I get that Apple wanted to proclaim loudly they have the best camera. I am not a camera nerd, all I want is the camera on my phone to take decent pictures, which it does. I don&rsquo;t care about all the whizzywigs, and I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a smartphone because it has the best camera. It feels like Apple is still playing the features game to convince people to throw down $1k on their phones, case in point, the portion of the event that got into the details of the A13 processor.</p>
<p>When I look at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/iphone-11-vs-the-competition/">this comparison</a> of phones, I am drawn to the Pixel 3A XL because it has enough features for the lowest price.</p>

<p>I understand the resistance in parting ways with the talent that got you the World Series three years ago, but I think it should be clear now that unless there are some diferent players in the lineup next year, you are going to end up with the same result.</p>
<p>Many will put blame on the manager, but he is not the person responsible for the roster, that lies with the front office. You clearly see a bias towards a single style of player that is good but not diverse enough, and that really doesn&rsquo;t give Madden many options to change things up.</p>
<p>Ownership has some hard decisions to make during the off season. It&rsquo;s easy to decide whether or not to spend money, it is much harder to decide whether the people running your team know how to change and if you do replace them, with whom?</p>
<p>I expect the Cubs to replace Madden because that is the easy choice that just about every team makes at this point. A different leadership style might spark a different emotional result, but it won&rsquo;t change how teams pitch to the Cubs.</p>

			 <p>As I write this, the 2019 Chicago Cubs have not scored a run in two and half games. In September. When you need to win games to win a division and/or make the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Cubs currently do not have a single player hitting .300 or better. What you have is a lineup of power hitters, and as appealing while the home run is a fan favorite, relying on it is not winning baseball. This lineup is too easy to pitch against.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been using Chromecast ever since Google first started selling them, and upgraded to the Ultras when they became available. One is attached to each of our two TVs, however I also have an Apple TV connected to the basement TV. I primarily use the Apple TV because I find the apps are better, for example the MLB app has a catch up feature only available on Apple TV.</p>
<p>I do occasionally stream ball games using the Chromecast on the Living Room TV but it has he annoying behavior of performance degrading after a couple hours of streaming. All of a sudden what I am watching starts stuttering and becomes unwatchable.</p>
<p>I don’t have solid evidence, but I suspect the Chromecast is overheating to the point after a few hours the performance suffers. The OS on the device might be throttling down performance to protect the CPU. The Chromecast is very hot when I touch it. I probably should get an HDMI extension to move it further away from the back of the TV.</p>
<p>Given my experience, if someone is in the market for a streaming video device I recommend the Apple TV unless you find the price prohibitive. I think the UI is good and it has had solid performance.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/a-comment-on/">A year ago</a> I signed up for <a href="https://exist.io/">Exist</a> in search of an application that would help me analyze the data I Collect in Google Fit. Unfortunately, it only imports a few months of historical data from Fit so I needed to wait until now to see the year over year benefit.</p>
<p>Now I can easily tell that I am walking less this week but more than last  year. I can easily see whether my monthly activity is above, at, or below my average. Exist also provides a way to track my moods and provide tags.</p>
<p>A few things that I wish Exist provided are a direct way to enter sleep information, similar to mood tracking. I don&rsquo;t use devices to track my sleep but I would like to simply be able to enter the times I went to bed and got up and provide a rating for how I think I slept. Not scientific, but a start.</p>
<p>I would like it to integrate with food tracking apps, or provide a direct way. Right now I am using LoseIt mostly to track carbs.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish it provided me a way to create my own queries/reports of data.</p>
<p>Overall I am happy with the service and can recommend it. Web, Android and iOS applications are available.</p>

			 <p>The Chicago Cubs have one of the best home records and one of the worst road records, and they have the best run differential in their division. People seem to be scratching their head over how the same team can be so good at home and so bad on the road. The problem is not the hitting, although they could be more consistent. To me the problem is the bullpen, they are giving up too many runs in the 6 thru 9th innings. Nobody in the pen is reliable.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago the bullpen wasn’t so important because starting pitchers pitched more innings and more often completed games. Now, starting pitchers are only expected to pitch six innings and that means you got have more pitching than ever before.</p>
<p>The Cubs overall pitching staff is not good enough. You might see an uptick in performance if they make the playoffs because the starters tend to go longer and you tend to narrow the pen down to a handful of pitchers, but I don’t expect the Cubs to get beyond be first round if they do make the playoffs.</p>
<p>I don’t know what specific things the Cubs need to do for next year. I don’t think the problem is with the managing or coaching, it seems to point to the talent in pitching. Lester and Hamel will be a year older and there doesn’t appear to be any replacements coming from the minors. The window on the talent the Cubs do have is getting smaller and it will be a shame if they only make it to one World Series.</p>

			 <p>During Presidential elections we hear a lot about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/warren-rural-policy-iowa/index.html">the plans</a> the candidates have for what they will do if elected. We want the candidates to have plans and we need to hear what they are, but we also tend to obsess over them a bit too much because for the most part they don&rsquo;t have direct control over their implementation.</p>
<p>A President needs to get Congress to pass legislation to implement his or her plans. Consequently we gauge their potential success of whether the President&rsquo;s party has a majority in the House and Senate.  Reality is that this rarely happens, and even so there may be members of the President&rsquo;s own party who don&rsquo;t agree, therefore what we need to evaluate is how persuasive a candidate is and whether they can lead compromise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we really tend to think of our candidates as dictators and that has manifested in Donald Trump. The founders did not intend Presidents to have such power, the representative republic they established vested Congress with job of governing by representing the citizens (House) and the states (Senate). In fact, through the electoral college, the Congress was intended to ultimately decide who is President.</p>

<p>23 Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. 24 Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, 26 for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. 27 As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 28 There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A23-28&amp;version=NRSV">Galations 3:23-28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too radical? Perhaps so for religions and countries birthed by Anglo-Saxons. If you call yourself a Christian, how do you imagine the Kingdom of God that Jesus constantly talked about looks like? Being one in Christ does NOT mean we are all the same like #AllLivesMatter. Being one in Christ means we see Christ in everyone and everything through our different skin colors, nationalities, and genders.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regrets, should we have them, are better addressed in the moment I think. We can apologize for our mistakes. We can make amends when we’ve hurt people. Most importantly, we can resolve to be better <em>now</em> instead of assuming things will work themselves out someday. We all know, at least at some level, that someday may never arrive.</p>

			 <p>Among our problems is a lack of understanding about some fundamentals. One is that greatness is not self-determined. Claiming that I am great does not make me so, that makes me arrogant. Whether or not I am great is determined by others who know me or work with me.</p>
<p>So, when Trump says &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; one should ask, who determines whether America is great? How do they determine that America is great?</p>
<p>Likewise, I don&rsquo;t think I can declare that I am not racist. I hope I am not, but I think only those of other races could determine whether or not I am racist by my actions and my character.</p>
<p>White man declaring he is not racist does not make it so, or does one white man saying another white man is not racist does not make it so.</p>

I did not work for Ross, but I did begin my career with a company (EDS) that still had his finger prints all over it. <a href="https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2019/07/ross-perot-legacy.aspx">Those finger prints</a> were completely gone by the end of the 90s. I don&rsquo;t think the value that Ross placed on employees exists in corporations today.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/06/24/in-a-youtube.html">The Risk Of Identifying As A Platform</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/06/24/in-a-youtube.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-24 11:50:00 -0400">Jun 24, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In a YouTube video recently posted, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&amp;v=W5g4sPi1wd4">Bill Gates said</a> something along the line of his greatest failure was to not lead Microsoft to produce a mobile operating system that would have been as successful as Android.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Everything-Windows-Mobile/dp/B002IKLN6K">I had an up front view of Microsoft&rsquo;s mobile operating systems</a> in the early 2000s and for Microsoft to create an Android would have required something akin to a labotomy. The Microsoft of the early 2000s saw itself as a platform company, that platform being Windows, and as a consequence, its prime objective was to protect the platform because to do so was to protect its existence.</p>
<p>To make something like Android Microsoft would have had to be willing to create a new platform rather than try to extend a desktop platform to mobile, which was doomed for failure. Microsoft could not fathom creating a second platform because to do so, in their mind, was to put Windows at risk. (Microsoft also applied the same thinking to the Internet.)</p>
<p>In my opinion the most important thing Satya Nadella did when we took over Microsoft is return to Microsoft&rsquo;s roots as a software developer and move away from identifying itself as a platform company. As a software developer Microsoft does not see it&rsquo;s entire existence depending on Windows, which allows it to embrace other platforms such a making a robust version of Microsoft Office for iOS and Android and even to integrate Linux with Windows.</p>
<p>Had Microsoft not got drunk on the Windows platform, starting with Windows 95, it might have been willing to embrace the Internet and mobile more fully and maintained itself as, in Bill Gate&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;the&rdquo; leading software company rather than &ldquo;a&rdquo; leading software company. It&rsquo;s easy to get drunk on the amount of money successful platforms provide and appear to provide forever.</p>
<p>Platforms are an institution, and most institutions naturally expend tremendous effort on self preservation. In my opinion the only way a platform company can truly exist over time is by being willing to put it&rsquo;s current platforms at risk of extinction through the creation of more viable future platforms. In my opinion some people in Google know this and that appears to be the reason why they are <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/google-fuchsia">quiently working on Fuchsia</a> but only time will tell whether this insight is fully embraced by those who are running the company.</p>

I have not removed the iPad from the case as much as I anticipated. Part of me wishes for the same case for the iPad Mini, but I do like using the Mini without a case.</p>

			 <p>I wonder, if the Republicans controlled the House, whether there would already be an impreachment inquiry open. Mueller served the role as investigator, collecting evidence and documenting his findings. The Constitution gives the House the job of prosecuting attorney (not the Attorney General) in determining whether to charge the President with a crime, which for the President has the unique label of impreachment.</p>
<p>A Republican inquiry would review the evidence, formally declare there is none to bring charges, and then the case is closed. Until the House says it is closed, the case is not closed no matter what Trump or Barr says. That is the Constitution.</p>
<p>To uphold their oath to the Constitution, Democrats in the House must open the impeachment inquiry and determine whether or not to vote articles of impeachment. They must be willing to take the political risk, if that exists, to fulfill their role in our government. It’s not about politics, it’s about the rule of law.</p>
<p>In fact, I think Congress should produce new presidential special consule legislation that states that all presidential special consule investigations require an impeachment inquiry to formalize the conclusions of the investigation.</p>
<p>If the criminal justice system cannot bring charges against a sitting president then Congress has to take serious this responsibility. That is unless Congress thinks the President really is above the law.</p>

<p>Mueller did the same thing as the Watergate investigation, he laid out the case for Congress to draw a conclusion on impeachment. In short, his entire effort was to layout the evidence for an impeachment inquiry to draw a conclusion, which exactly what the Constitution intends. If the House does not open an inquiry then it is discrediting Mueller&rsquo;s work and not upholding their own oath to the Constitution. In the end, they might not draft articles of impeachment, but they absolutely should open the inquiry.</p>
<p>Props to Amash for having the integrity to put his oath over party loyalty.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/crostini">Crostini</a> Linux containers on my Google Pixelbook melted down after I upgraded the Pixelbook to the stable release of Chrome OS 74, a reminder that Linux Apps (Crostini) is very much in beta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/crostini-failure-after-chrome-os-74-upgrade">the details</a> of what occurred, the trigger seems to be that I had two containers. After Chrome OS 74 installs and you launch a container, such as by starting the Terminal app, you see a message telling you that the Linux apps is being upgraded and the app you wish to run will load after the upgrade completes.</p>
<p>I saw the message for the primary container, named penguin, and everything worked as planned. The meltdown began when I started Gnome Terminal, which was in the second container, the one in which I was running Docker. The upgrade message appeared but the upgrade did not seem to complete. After letting it run for an hour, which was much longer than the prior upgrade, I restarted the Pixelbook, and either that or the upgrade rendered the container usable.</p>
<p>From here a few attempts to fix the problem cascaded the meltdown to primary container too. My attempts to re-build and restore the primary container from a backup failed and I am left to re-building from scratch. Not totally awful given that I had no real data in either container, just apps with a bit of data synced to a cloud or github.</p>
<p>I am not entirely sure what happened. I might have been too impatient and the second container may have upgraded had I just let it run. Or, it might be that running Docker in the second container created problems.</p>
<p>The moral of this blog post is that even if you are sticking to the Chrome OS stable channel, Linux Apps (Crostini) is still in beta and thus breakage can and will occur.</p>

The biggest news from the keynote were hardware related.</p>
<p>One is the consolidation of Google Home and Nest, the Nest brand remains. With this consolidation is a new video hub, the Nest Hub Max.</p>
<p>The other big news was the announcement of two new, power priced phones, the Pixel 3a and 3a XL. While not unexpected, still interesting timing given that Google announced the Pixel 3/3XL last October.</p>

			 <p>Abraham Lincoln on the Kansas-Nebraska Act:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world—enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites—causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty—criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and <strong>insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest.</strong>&rdquo; from &ldquo;These Truths: A History of the United States&rdquo; by Jill Lepore

			 <p>I got a new iPad Mini for my birthday. It is noticeably faster than the Mini 4 and I am happy to be able to use the Apple Pencil with it. I have found that GoodNotes can be configured for vertical scrolling rather than horizontal so it best approximates the Newton notepad.</p>
<p>The setup process for moving from one iPad to another is pretty neat. It automatically detects the old nearby iPad and establishes a connection to it by scanning a barcode with the camera. All the settings transfer and apps restore from a recent backup. Not all app settings, particularly logins, restore so I am finding that I have to check each app individually.</p>

			 <p>I have been having fun breaking and fixing my wiki over the last several days, and in the process learned more about wiki. Wiki is written in nodejs and there is a wiki-server and a wiki-client along with several plugins. My adventures began when an update was made to wiki-client that broke the ability to use HTML forms in a wiki page. A fix was made to wiki-client that resolved the problem but my server was not getting the update.</p>
<p>It appears that somewhere along the line I managed to install wiki in two different directories on my server. The install from which I was running wiki was not updating when I ran npm install -g wiki and it took me a while to figure out how to <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/run-wiki-from-global-installation">run the global install instance of wiki</a> that I was updating.</p>
<p>Today I removed the &ldquo;second&rdquo; installation but now I have to provide the full path to the correct, current, installation of wiki. When I just run wiki it tries to run it from a directory in which it is no longer located. I must have an alias or script pointing it in that direction but for now I haven&rsquo;t figured it out.</p>
<p>Anyway, I now have the current verison of wiki-client so I can now fill in html forms, one of which is for a search plugin that now appears to be broken. Oy vey! Search works on a older installation on my Pixelbook, but the new version/current version is not working.</p>
<p>At least I did manage to get the graphviz plugin installed (you can see it in action <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/preview-next-diagram">on this page</a>), figuring out how to set up myself as an admin user to do the installation took time to suss out.</p>
<p>Breaking and fixing things is a important part of the learning process when learning software.</p>

<p>Drug companies are able to pay PBMs — as well as hospitals and some doctors — to make sure cheaper drugs are left out. It’s as simple as that. Drug companies pay everyone along the way so that lower-price drugs lose.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have competition when the system is gamed, and those who argue against &ldquo;single payer&rdquo; health insurance always hinge their argument on competition. If you don&rsquo;t want to change health insurance then do something about the costs with regulation that forces competition.</p>

			 <p>I have been reading Dave Winer&rsquo;s writing for a long time, and a common theme of his writing is journalism. My translation of what he has been saying is that news has become a platform, and as such anyone can do it, and those who are employed as journalists need to shift from being gatekeepers to being participants. True platforms route around gatekeepers.</p>
<p>The reason why this message is not well received by journalists is obvious, it&rsquo;s because <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html">what they hear is that you no longer have a job</a>. Staying employed is important to these people and you cannot blame them because it is how they support their families.</p>
<p>When the constitution was written people like Benjamin Franklin viewed journalism as a vocation because frankly the idea of a &ldquo;job&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really exist. When vocations became professions, a shift in priorities took place, with maintaining employment moving to the top. When journalism transformed to media thanks to corporate consolidation, the move to journalism being about money became complete.</p>
<p>The honest question that has been avoided ever since is, is what we have, journalism as media to make profits, consistent with the &ldquo;fourth estate&rdquo; established by the First Amendment? If the prime objective of the Consitution, of which the First Amendment is a part, is to be the United in the United States of America, then today&rsquo;s media is not that which the first amendment refers to because there is more profits generated from disunity than unity.</p>
<p>Citizens instinctively know that the profits that corporate ownership demands is corupting, and therefore they do not trust media because they know there is a bias towards making money over telling truth.</p>
<p>Of course Fox News is giving their viewers what they want to hear, that is how they make money! Of course MSNBC is giving their viewers what they want to hear, that is how they make money! Of course the New York Times is giving their readers what they want to red, that is how they make money!</p>
<p>On and on it goes. It is another example of how hyper capitalism is destroying republican democracy and thus destroying our country.</p>

			 <p>Ever since Google announced they were no longer supporting Inbox I have been looking for a replacement app. I found Spark to be the best app to provide the main features I like: bundling and one-click bundle archiving. Unfortunately, up until today it has only been available on iOS, but now I am able to <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/blog/spark-mail-arrives-on-android">install it on my Pixel 2</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/04/01/in-december-microblog.html">Testing Micro.blog Wordpress Export</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In December micro.blog stopped exporting my site to Github, a consequence of their change from jekyll to hugo as the CMS. We do have manual ways to export a site, one is to download an export file as a Wordpress export and the other is to generate an archive in a &ldquo;blog archive format&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be well documented. Manton wrote <a href="https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html">a post</a> proposing the format in 2017, but I have not found anything else so it doesn&rsquo;t appear that format is useful to anyone other than programmers.</p>
<p>An export is only as good as the ability to import, so I decided to create a local install of <a href="https://medium.com/@tatemz/local-wordpress-development-with-docker-3-easy-steps-a7c375366b9">Wordpress on my Pixelbook using Docker</a> and then try importing the Wordpress export. The good news is that the import was successful. <del>The bad news is that the export file retains markdown that is not converted to HTML so none of the links in the posts appear correctly. We either need the micro.blog export process to convert to HTML or some way for the import process to convert markdown to HTML.</del></p>
<p>Update: I was directed to install the JP Markdown plug in to my site, which I did and then did a wipe and re-import and the good news is that with it installed all the markdown formating is appearing on the local Wordpress site.</p>

			 <p>Oddly, one of the challenging things about wiki is creating new pages. A new page is created by first creating a link to the page and then adding items to that page, therefore I have <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/recent-changes/view/now">the Now page</a> on which I create new links.</p>
<p>The problem is, those new links can accumulate over time and then I have to back and remove them. I have found code for an HTML form to create a new page so that I can enter a page title, click create, and a new ghost page appears.</p>

Granted, Apple&rsquo;s is a Credit Card while Google&rsquo;s was only a debit card, but the hurdles are similar. How do you get people to switch and why should they if they can use their existing credit card with Apple Pay?  I get the desire to make money on transactions, that is a repeat of the Apple Store model that makes Apple a lot of money. However, in this instance I don&rsquo;t see why I or anyone would switch.</p>

			 <p>Our current state can be traced to the early 90s, which happens to coincide with thinking originating at the Harvard Business School that CEO compensation should be tied to stock performance.

Unfortunately, the idea is <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1db3jy3201d38/The-MBA-Myth-and-the-Cult-of-the-CEO">a theory that is proving to be false</a>.</p>

However, it seems to me one thing we don&rsquo;t consider is that what might be the best way to address the problem is to enable people to have a good life where they currently live.  People who are well off in South America don&rsquo;t take the risk of traveling thousands of miles to the United States, desperate people take that risk. Building a wall is not going to stop people from taking that risk. A wall is a band aid, not a solution.</p>

I attended Tech from the fall of 1984 to the spring of 1989 and you see that during that time two monthly records were set, in November 1985 and February 1989.  My last year at Tech had the most snow with 333 total inches.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Commerce Department said this week that despite two years of America First-ism, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit is getting worse rather than better.After all the fuss about the tax cuts, it turns out that corporations benefited, not workers. And while joblessness is  at an all-time low, the economy turns out to be churning out many more jobs at the bottom end of the skills market than middle-class jobs. Wages still lag, city centers are still rotting, infrastructure projects are still crumbling, public housing is still in trouble.  Oh and then there is this massive debt resulting from unpaid for tax cuts.  At the border, the Trump protectionist approach appears to be not working, as the monthly immigration numbers attest.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, some will say that Trump&rsquo;s election is a shake up of the two party system. He is certainly not a conservative Republican it is arguable whether he is a Republican at all.</p>
<p>The problem with Congress is that it has become nothing more than an extension of the President&rsquo;s &ldquo;team.&rdquo; Congress doesn&rsquo;t exist as a separate entity and therefore does not fulfill is role as the second branch of government, and that is bad because Congress' role is fundamental to the republican form of democracy created by the Constitution.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, a vast amount of what is claimed to be judicial overreach is also created by Congress not doing their job.</p>

<p>To desire to keep down the rate of wages, with the view of favoring the exportation of merchandise, is to seek to render the citizens of a state miserable, in order that foreigners may purchase its productions at a cheaper rate; it is, at most, attempting to enrich a few merchants by impoverishing the body of the nation; it is taking the part of the stronger in that contest, already so unequal, between the man who can pay wages, and him who is under the necessity of receiving them; it is, in one word, to forget, that the object of every political society ought to be the happiness of the largest number.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/us-health-care-private-insurance-employment-b34153c8-bfd6-449f-9e06-3bafc2ccc0a6.html">Axios rightly points a major flaw in healthcare</a> in the United States, that insurance is tied to employment. Another major flaw is even calling it insurance.</p>
<p>Insurance is really about probabilities and statistics, and insurance companies are essentially gambling on the premise that there is a lower probability of paying out money than taking in money.</p>
<p>Car insurance is real, one might go a life time without ever having to file a claim yet must pay for it regardless if you own a car. (BTW, in most states one MUST buy at least liability insurance.)</p>
<p>If car insurance were like health insurance one would be filing a claim every time they took their car in for an oil change or some other repair.</p>
<p>With the frequency of payouts, the real question is, why would any private corporation want to even be in the health insurance business? The only way it can be profitable to a corporation is to take in more money by charging more than they pay out. Can you not seen the fundamental problem here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the close of the Cold War, some commentators concluded that the American experiment had ended in triumph, that the United States had become all the world. But the American experiment had not in fact ended. A nation founded on revolution and universal rights will forever struggle against chaos and the forces of particularism. A nation born in contradiction will forever fight over the meaning of its history.</p>

For people concerned about the performance impact of Crostini running on a Chromebook, I note that the virtual machine and any containers within do not automatically start on boot and therefore the cleanest way to run is to not launch the Linux Terminal app, which you see when you enable the Linux apps beta on Chrome OS.</p>
<p>The first time you launch the Terminal app the virtual machine (termina) and default container (penguin) start, which accounts for the longer than perhaps expected time to launch.</p>

<p>The United States is in a state of emergency: 28 national ones and many more local. This might come as a surprise, but it isn’t new—this month marks the start of our 39th year in a continuous emergency state. What is an emergency, and how did we get here? This post explains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1976 National Emergencies Act requires Congress to meet every six months to end the state of emergency. If you want to know why Democracy is failing in the United States, read no further than the following&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not once has Congress met to consider such a vote. It is not exactly clear why. But the provision would have lost much of its intended force even had Congress complied: It originally allowed Congress to end an emergency by concurrent resolution (that is, if majorities in both houses voted to end it). But in 1983, the Supreme Court declared this sort of legislative veto over presidential action unconstitutional. A 1985 amendment to the act now requires a joint resolution to end the emergency, meaning that any Congressional vote to end the emergency is subject to the president’s veto, which may be overridden only by two-thirds majorities of both houses.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had the same reaction to Howard Schultz&rsquo;s comment about the American Dream <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/31/213234.html">as Dave</a>. When I was growing up the American Dream was equated to the Middle Class, by which I mean adults aspired to having a comfortable life and dreamt of a better life for their children.</p>
<p>While I do agree with Schultz in that another way to describe the American Dream is to be successful, I think the biggest problem is measuring success by wealth. The focus on wealth in America is allowing us to accept the huge income inequality that exists in our country.</p>
<p>For me, Schultz implying that Elizabeth Warren and others want to punish him and others for being successful is totally wrong. What we want is for the very wealthy people to contribute a share to society commensurate with their ability.</p>
<p>Schultz might want to put on an indepedent label, but his ideology is conservative Republican selling himself as a Democrat Ross Perot.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://politicalwire.com/2019/01/24/gop-senators-getting-nervous/">Dear Republican Senators</a>. You should be nervous, and the U.S. Constitution gives you the power to open the government, you simply override the President&rsquo;s veto. You serve the citizens of the United States, you do not serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States. Your job is not to just enable what the President wants, your job is to write laws that govern our country. Do your job. A good first step is to pass and override any veto to the appropriations laws to open the government. The next step is to replace Mitch McConnell as your Senate leader.</p>
<p>Simply serving at the pleasure of your party&rsquo;s President is in practice nothing more than a monarchy/authoritarian rule. If you truly believe in democracy, if you are to uphold your oath to the Constitution, you will exert your authority as the co-equal branch of government who has as one of its primary purposes oversight of the executive branch of government.</p>
<p>Do your job. The Republic depends on you, otherwise we slip in to the same tyranny from which we revoluted against and it will be under your watch and will be your legacy.</p>

			 <p>Amazon is testing <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/transportation/meet-scout">an autonomous delivery cart</a>. What it doesn&rsquo;t show is where it starts from, how it delivers along its route, how one is notified it is waiting for you to pick up your delivery, and how it secures other people&rsquo;s packages.</p>
<p>I do not like Amazon&rsquo;s in-house delivery because it is not as professional as Fedex, UPS, or USPS. What I observe is that their drivers do not know their route and will &ldquo;deliver&rdquo; your package anywhere.. you might find in your neighbor&rsquo;s back yard.</p>

			 <p>The real problem with the zeal in declaring anything <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-edge-mobile-fake-news/">fake news</a> is the question of who decides what is real news? The problem isn&rsquo;t whether or not something is fake, the real problem is how is something decided to be real.</p>
<p>When Trump says someone&rsquo;s reporting is fake, what is really saying is that if he isn&rsquo;t the one telling you then it is fake.</p>

<p>The exorbitant prices confound patients and doctors alike since insulin is nearly a century old now. The pricing is all the more infuriating when one considers that the discoverers of insulin sold the patent for $1 each to ensure that the medication would be affordable. Today the three main manufacturers of insulin are facing a lawsuit accusing them of deceptive pricing schemes, but it could be years before this yields any changes.</p>

			 <p>So, Mitch McConnell is the literally the person causing the shutdown because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2018%E2%80%932019">as the Republican Senate majority leader</a> he refuses to take up the appropriations bills passed by the House of Representatives. Blame Mitch not Trump.</p>
<p>If you recall from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otbml6WIQPo">How A Bill Becomes A Law</a>, Congress has the ability to override the President&rsquo;s veto. So, if the Senate passed the bills passed by the House, they go to the President, and if he vetos then is back in Congress' power to override the bills in which they become law.</p>
<p>So once again, Congress has within its power given to it by the Constitution to govern and like so many times in the past Mitch McConnell is not living up to his oath.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to start putting pressure on the Republicans and McConnell.</p>

			 <p>The real problem with social networks like Facebook and Twitter is that they require using their servers that store all of what you write and share. By nature of the fact that you are using their servers Facebook and Twitter have the right and ability to access what you write and share.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2588287/networking/networking-peer-to-peer-network.html">peer to peer network</a> takes a server, like Facebook and Twitter&rsquo;s, out of the middle. What you write and share goes directly from your computer to the computer of others on the peer to peer network. Because this information can actually end up on many more computers most peer to peer networks encrypt what is passed around. Consequently, only the people who have access to your public or private keys can actually read what you write. (By the way, in a simple way I have just explained one reason why <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/">blockchain</a> has been written so much about.)</p>

			 <p>I am intrigued by the number of alternative social network products being developed. Some consider <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, which I have been using, as one. I think of Micro.blog as a hybrid decentralized environment, but which I mean you can use it to either store content on their server, like I do, or use it to facilitate content you store an other site.  I store what I write on <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my blog</a> and transmit copies of that to Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>However, I suspect that if it becomes dead simple, reliable, and secure, a peer-to-peer type of network like <a href="https://infourminutes.co/whitepaper/scuttlebutt">Secure Scuttlebutt</a> will be the winner.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> for a long time. One of the problems I have always had with Evernote is that it doesn&rsquo;t really provide a simple structure for notes. With just Notebooks and Tags building structure can turn your Evernote environment in to a big mess.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kanbanote.com/">Kanbanote</a> looks like an interesting alternative for layering a structured view on top of Evernote, treating Evernote as a back end data store.</p>

			 <p>Remember when a president who really wanted to start a war in Iraq claimed there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and he had his war and no such weapons were found? Seems to me we have another president making similar claims of a crisis to get his way. We ought to be skeptical.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a request for the project plan for building this wall. Where is the budget? Where are the bids for the construction? How do we know the price is $5 billion and not $10 billion or $2 billion?</p>

<p>What is also important to understand is that what has been going here is emotional manipulation, that is what advertising is all about. Generations of Americans, starting with the Baby Boomers, have been programmed with emotional manipulation, which is why now, seemingly all of a sudden, &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; is such a thing. The Internet is an echo chamber of emotional manipulation, which is why the social network hacking has been so effective.</p>

			 <p>One thing I remember President Reagan  ask for is the ability to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto_in_the_United_States">line-item vetos</a>.  The thing is that the Constitution provides the power of the line-item veto to Congress through its ability to write and pass legislation. Trump is pulling an anti-Reagan move, demanding something added to legislation that Congress has passed.</p>
<p>Compromise, which does NOT mean that one side gives in to another, is the whole point upon which the Founders built our government.</p>

Without that confrontation with an infection, the system is left unprimed and will not work properly.”</p>

<p>This book is a proposal to rethink religion so that our definitions are both more accurate and more inclusive of the variety of religious experience around the world. It also is an argument that there is a way to be religious and modern, open minded, progressive, appreciative of science, tolerant, and a peaceful global citizen of the 21st century.</p>

<p>I think part of the reason why Russia&rsquo;s influence on the 2016 Presidential election was so effective is the conditioning we have had through the emotional manipulation of advertising. Mindless sharing on social networks is the purest form of that emotional manipulation because we tend to trust our friends without question.</p>

It was our business model in media that favored confrontation over resolution. It was our business model in advertising that valued volume, attention, page views, and eyeballs — the business model that then corrupted the internet. It was our failure to inform the public that enabled people to vote against their self-interest for Trump or Brexit.</p>

			 <p>Made my third trip to the eye glasses place to get my new glasses adjusted and confirm that the prescription is right and the measurements are right. I have a pretty significant stigmatism and the introduction of progressives has complicated the process of getting new lenses. Every pair I have had since progressives has required multiple trips to get the fit right, and one time the lenses had to be remade.</p>
<p>Today I got the manager/customer advocate take care of me. The first lesson learned is that for my prescription, experience matters. The customer advocate confirmed the measurements are correct and he did adjust the frame so that the glasses now feel better and sit better on my face.</p>
<p>I learned that my progressive prescription changed pretty significantly for my right eye, so that means I would definitely have a noticable difference and need more time to adjust. Most importantly, he told me that due to the change I need to hold what I am reading closer to force my eyes to read through the progressives. Holding a book where I had in the past put it at the mid-way point, which causes strain. Nobody told me this, I don&rsquo;t know how I was supposed to know.</p>
<p>So, now I know I have to change what I do and I have to give my eyes/brain time to adjust. These simple but important pieces of information should have been given to me either at the first appointment or when I first picked up the glasses. My theory about this customer experience is that the experience of the people taking care of you matters. They probably don&rsquo;t see my particular prescription often, and then 20 somethings doing the work simply don&rsquo;t have the experience to handle my prescription.</p>

			 <p>I still wish I could batch all of my blog posts for a day into one titled batch, with the title being that day&rsquo;s date.

			 <p>I got an idea. If you look at the Discuss link on <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/12/21/if-there-were.html">this post</a>, you see that it points back to the discussion thread on micro.blog. What if when you tapped that link on iOS it launched the micro.blog app? Right now it just opens the thread in a web page. On Windows if you are logged in to micro.blog you can actually reply and participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>You see, I think of micro.blog as a blogging platform and not as a Twitter alternative so I envision the blog is a starting point and not the micro.blog timeline. If one starts on the blog and I want follow up discussion, I should be able to make it happy. Adding a link like I did is easy enough.</p>

			 <p>The iPad and <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> is evolving into my preferred blogging platform due to a shortcut I created that quotes text from web pages in the exact format that I prefer. I use Omnibear in Chrome on my notebook computers but doesn&rsquo;t automatically grab the web page title, address, and selected text like the shortcut. I think I used to have a bookmarklet that did the job back during my earlier blogging days.</p>
<p>Oh, and the fact that Drafts makes it easier to link to pages doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>The problem is, I don&rsquo;t only use my iPad, so when I am reading on another computer it is a bit disruptive to have to switch computers to write a blog post.</p>

			 <p>Progress cannot happen amongst people who are unwilling to accept they could be wrong. The scientific method is based on the truth that ideas, hypothesis, can be wrong and hence requires proof of  hypothesis that is peer reviewed and consensed as being right or most likely right. Proofs are not only facts but also consensed arguments of what is most likely right. Built in to science is acceptance that what may be considered a proven correct hypothesis today could be proven incorrect hypothesis tomorrow and that is considered to be progress.</p>

			 <p>I think that unregulated capitalism is really survival of the fittest applied to wealth. Left unchecked, as it mostly is today, pure capitalism leads to monopolies that destroy any real free market.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in the 1980s a new idea quickly took hold: American corporations should focus only on maximizing returns to their shareholders. That had a seismic impact on the American economy. In the early 1980s, America&rsquo;s biggest companies dedicated less than half of their profits to shareholders and reinvested the rest in the company. But over the last decade, big American companies have dedicated 93% of earnings to shareholders - redirecting trillions of dollars that could have gone to workers or long-term investments. The result is that booming corporate profits and rising worker productivity have not led to rising wages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smith, 61, retired after the 1997 season with more saves than any player before him. His saves still rank third all-time behind Mariano Rivera and Trevor Hoffman. A seven-time All-Star and three-time Rolaids Relief Man Award winner, Smith led his league in saves four times, including a career-best 47 in 1991, and had 30-plus saves in 10 of his 18 seasons with the Cubs, Red Sox, Cardinals, Yankees, Orioles, Angels, Reds and Expos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lee Smith more or less ascended to the closer role after Bruce Sutter went to the Cardinals, and was the Cubs closer through my high school years. He was a classic power pitcher who occasionally would grove a fastball for a home run. Sutter is in the Hall of Fame and I think it&rsquo;s right that Smith joins him.</p>

			 <p>A REPLY TO RICHARD ROHR ON THE COSMIC CHRIST – Omega Center
Ilia Delio,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christ is the communion of divine personal love expressed in every created form of reality—every star, leaf, bird, fish, tree, rabbit and every human person. Everything is christified because everything expresses divine love incarnate.  However, Jesus Christ is the “thisness” of God (‘God is like this and this is God’) so what Jesus is by nature everything else is by grace (divine love).   We are not God but every single person is born out of the love of God, expresses this love in his/her unique personal form and has the capacity to be united with God.  It is for this reason that the Franciscan theologian Bonaventure described the mystery of Jesus Christ as a coincidence of opposites.  Because Jesus _is _the Christ, every human is already reconciled with every other human in the mystery of divine so that Christ is more than Jesus alone; Christ is the whole reality bound in a union of love.</p>

Ilia Delio,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we say, “Jesus is the Christ,” we are saying that the humanity of Jesus is one with divinity, the “mystery hidden from the beginning of the world.”   There is a particularity here, a <em>haecceitas</em> (or thisness) that cannot be overlooked.   Jesus _is _the Christ which means all that God is, is given to us in Jesus, rendering a new understanding of God as relational, self-communicative, self-emptying.</p>

			 <p>I am having problems at the moment using OneNote  on my iPad Pro, so have reverted to my backup Surface 3 and OneNote. What I had not appreciated up to now is how much better it is to write on the iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil than on the Surface 3 and Surface Pen. I am finding writing it frustratingly slow to write on the Surface 3, and I would not have said that before having used the iPad Pro/Pencil for a year.</p>

			 <p>I recently built <a href="http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">my own Federated Wiki server</a> and have been having a lot fun adding content to it since. I&rsquo;ve found that for me it is the best way to maintain a &ldquo;Now&rdquo; page of things I am currently working on or researching.</p>
<p>As a topic comes up, I got to <a href="http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/now">the Now page</a> and create a wiki link to the topic, which I then click to create a new page to which I start adding content.</p>
<p>What I need to determine is what to do with the topics that I complete. I think the ideal solution is a plugin that automatically generates an index of all pages in my wiki so that even when I remove the wiki link in the Now page, a link to the page remains somewhere so that it can be found later. I could manually build an index, but in this day and age I would think an automated approach would be possible and best.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few weeks ago I read <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</a> by Mike Caulfield and it really resonated with me. In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden.</p>
<p>One thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked. My affinity toward structure is also why I find outlines appealing.</p>
<p>Chronology (reverse), archives, and permalinks are structures of blogs that I think distinguish it technologically from &ldquo;regular&rdquo; web sites. The informal personal voice of blogs is what distinguishes the blog writing style from other writing styles you see on the web.</p>
<p>And yet, blogs writing is also point in time. One writes a blog post, it enters the stream, and beyond perhaps that first day one rarely, if ever, edits or adds to a blog post.</p>
<p>The ongoing revision of a piece of writing is fundamentally what I think Caulfield means by &ldquo;the garden.&rdquo; With that paradigm, I created two &ldquo;projects&rdquo;, the first being a web page in which I originally wrote about <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html">which Chromebook I was going to buy</a> and then continually revised that page as I learned more up until I made my decision. The second project is a new page in which I am recording <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/11/25/google-pixelbook.html">my experience with using the Pixelbook</a>.</p>
<p>In both instances I created and maintained those pages using jekyll and offline tools like Drafts and Typora, which I find works very well. However, it feels that a wiki is more in tune with the garden concept which is why <a href="http://testing.frankmcpherson.net">I have been dabbling with wikis</a>.</p>
<p>Right now, this whole thing is work in progress. I think I favor the offline ability I have with my jekyll and Netlify set up versus in browser editing required by DokuWiki.</p>

<p>Wear OS Update H installed on my watch two days ago. There appears to be a problem recovering from the new &ldquo;deep sleep&rdquo; / suspend mode. At intermittent times the watch appears to be unresponsive, basically it looks as though it is frozen after I attempt to wake it by either moving my arm, tapping the screen or pressing the crown. Eventually it does come back/recover, which leads me to suspect the watch has gone in to suspend/deep sleep and takes a long time to resume. I appreciate the idea of saving battery life by going into such a state, but the watch needs to recover much faster as right now it is a horrible user experience. Is anyone else seeing this? Is this a known problem with a fix in progress, or is there a way to disable this &ldquo;feature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I started to notice this behavior yesterday. I&rsquo;ve restarted the watch in hopes that might resolve. My fear is that this is a processor issue causing this watch to not be able to resume from this form of suspend fast enough.</p>

			 <p>News about <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/grab-a-pixelbook-for-699-on-black-friday-and-score-3-months-of-youtube-tv/">the Black Friday sale on the Google Pixelbook</a> has me reconsidering <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html">my plan</a> to buy a new Chromebook.</p>
<p>While the Lenovo and HP Chromebooks that I have been looking at have an 8th generation Intel processor, the Pixelbook is an overall better machine and I imagine its 7th generation Intel processor will server me equally well.  On the other hand, that U processor in the Lenovo is definitely better performing that the Y processor, which Apple choose for the new Macbook Air.</p>
<p>I had not considered the Pixelbook due to normal $999 price. The sale price is in line with the version of the Lenovo C630 I am considering. Food for thought, does anyone have advice on which one to go with?</p>

			 <p>I was on <a href="https://mobiletoday.podbean.com/e/mobileviews-podcast-275-10-year-retrospective/">the MobileViews Podcast</a> this past weekend, and I talked about Google&rsquo;s operating systems and commented on how few new operating systems came it to market during the ten years of the podcast.. Chrome OS, first released in 2011, is the newest I&rsquo;ve used, and even that can be debated because it uses a Linux Kernel.</p>
<p>According to my past weblog posts, <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2009/01/10/giving-palm-its-just-due/">WebOS may be the newest</a> prior to Chrome OS. Android and iOS already existed for a few years.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/ipad_pro/">Getting the iPad to Pro</a></p>
<p>Would there even be a debate about whether an iPad can be one&rsquo;s only computer if touchscreens were invented before the mouse? IMHO the major impediment is iOS' lack of support for Bluetooth mice.</p>
<p>I think if Apple wanted to, they could take a cue from Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/">Project Crostini</a> to add containerized desktop app support to iOS. The Pros would be smart enough to handle containers, while the normal users would probably not want nor need it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long mused that what we really need are devices that have built-in hypervisors upon which one could run any operating environment they wished. Containers come close to this idea.</p>

			 <p>I am not feeling euphoric by seeing Democrats win the House. I am heartend by the number of women who ran and won, but this is just the first step. Before <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/democrats-trump-investigations/">the Dems go crazy with investigations</a>, they should consider why Trump won in the first place. We need progress on real issues more than we need revenge.</p>
<p>If the Democrats in the House fall into the trap of Washington nazel gazing this small victory could lead to a Trump re-election in 2020. Yes, provide oversight, but more importantly listen to <strong>all</strong> of your constituents and try to do something to help them!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been traveling over the past week, visiting family and friends throughout Michigan and Wisconsin. This morning I am packing up to depart on the next leg of my trip and struck by how few bags I have on this trip.</p>
<p>Ten years ago when I made this trip I packed one or two plastic bins for power cords, surge protectors, WiFi access points and more. I may have had a few bags for computers and then my regular luggage.</p>
<p>Now, all of my electronics that includes one notebook computer, two tablets, and their associated cords all fit in to one backpack. I have on suitecase and that is it. Obviously, the electronics that I carry is much smaller than ten years ago, but I am also helped by updated hotels with plenty of power outlets and WiFi. No more hunting around and moving furniture to find an available outlet.</p>

			 <p>I am trying out <a href="https://www.trunknotes.com/">TrunkNotes</a>, which I learned about here on micro.blog. TrunkNotes is a personal wiki very similar to <a href="https://www.voodoopad.com/">VoodooPad</a>. <del>One thing I am trying to recall about VoodooPad is whether it automatically creates links to new pages for wiki words, I thought it did while TrunkNotes does not. TrunkNotes will create a link to a page if one associated to the wiki word already exists and I find that more limiting than if the app automatically created links whether the page already existed or not. The current method requires going back to edit pages to add links to other pages.</del></p>
<p>Found out that I did not create a valid wiki word, which is why TrunkNotes did not auotmatically create a link for a new page. It turns out TrunkNotes works exactly as I want it to.</p>

<p>I think blog posts are a form of writing that is under appreciated. First, few people remember that blog is actually a shortcut for weblog, literally a log of the web. Most log entries are short descriptions.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t write this to criticize, there is no right or wrong, instead I want to point out that a blog has always meant to be simple and true to one&rsquo;s voice. You don&rsquo;t have to write volumes nor have a witty title. Just link to something on the web and perhaps explain why you think it worth sharing. For that matter the blog can simply be for yourself.</p>

			 <p>My Notes From The Apple Event</p>
<p>Tim Cook was max PT Barnum at the Apple Event, which I find annoying after listening for 20 minutes. At this point they can just move on to the announcements, the forced excitement and employee enthused applause is becoming old.</p>
<p>The $1200 price for the new MacBook Air is pretty much what I expected. Given how the MacBook has been redesigned, I am not sure why one would not just get a MacBook rather than an Air.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Mac Mini got a nice spec upgrade retaining the $800 price, which is cheap for a Mac but not so much relative to other desktops. I guess if you want a low cost Mac, the Mini is the one to get, as always.</p>
<p>The new iPad Pros were the star of the event, and they have me wishing I did not buy my iPad last year. For me the slightly larger screen and CPU upgrades are very appealing.</p>
<p>Can the new Pencil work with older iPad Pros? I need to learn more about the Pencil, and if it works with old Pros I may buy one. Can 2 Pencils connect to an iPad at the same time?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A human being,” wrote Einstein in reply, “is a part of the whole, called by us “Universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a founda tion for inner security.”</p>

			 <p>The gist of <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2801077-packers-put-aaron-rodgers-in-impossible-situation-and-he-keeps-delivering">the articles</a> currently being written about Aaron Rodgers and the Packers is that the Packers are wasting what time they have left with Aaron. Frankly, I had the same complaints about how the Packer&rsquo;s treated the second half of Brett Farve&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>You have one of the best, if not the best, quarterbacks in the league, but you do not keep him surrounded by good talent. Good receivers, running backs, offensive line, or defense. You put in place a coach who frankly doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>The Packers were very fortunate to have drafted Aaron and that he was better than they most likely thought when he was drafted. Most teams do not replace one hall of fame quarterback with another hall of fame quarterback. It is not likely they will do the same when it comes time for Aaron to step down, and that means that every season that Aaron plays in which you don&rsquo;t win a Super Bowl could be another year added to many, many years of not winning one.</p>

			 <p>We saw Elton John last night for the first and last time, as this is his farewell tour and I believe it to be true. The show was fantastic, particularly when you consider that Elton is 71 years old. He played for a little over two and a half hours, with no intermission. After each song he would stand up, acknowledge the crowd as he did a circle around the piano seat, take a drink of water, sit down and launch into another song.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen a musical act with so much percussion. Two full drum sets, three drummers, including tympani, bells, and tambourine. The dude playing the tambourine, which was well miced, got more video time than the guitars. The act, however, had no cowbell.</p>
<p>Finally, a couple notes on Little Caesar’s Arena. It was the first concert that we attended at LCA. In an email the day before we were told the arena would open at 6:30 PM and encouraged people to come early, Elton was starting promptly at 8 PM. The arena didn’t open until 7 PM, which was very annoying.</p>
<p>We had seats in the upper bowl, which frankly were the cheapest seats. The climb to the seats in the upper bowl is pretty steep, and I felt bad for some of thr elderly and disabled who made the climb.</p>

			 <p>Google classifies the Pixel Slate as <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate">a Tablet with Google Assistant</a>. Based on <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/11/my-definition-of.html">my definition of tablets</a>, the Slate is not a tablet, it is a 2-in-1. If you stick to Google&rsquo;s view of it as a tablet then I stand by <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/09/first-reaction-to.html">my initial impression</a> that the Slate could be DOA.</p>
<p>My concerns about it are driven by the total cost of ownership. I start with the 8 GB, 64 GB, Intel Core M model that costs $799, and then add a keyboard, either the Google keyboard that costs $199 or the <a href="https://www.brydge.com/pages/gtype-keyboard-for-google-pixel-slate">Brydge G-Type</a> that costs $159, making the minimum total cost $958; throw in the pen and that is just north of $1,000. For my money I much rather buy the Pixelbook or any one of the newer Chromebooks than pay $1000 for the Slate 2-in-1. Arguably <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-6/8zcnc665slq5?icid=surfacedept_nav3_surfacefamily_100218&amp;activetab=pivot:techspecstab">the Surface Pro 6</a> is a better option, and it would definitely be better for me because I know I can use a pen with OneNote.</p>
<p>The Slate does look like a nice piece of hardware, and if you want Android and Linux apps on a 2-in-1 it&rsquo;s your only viable option, but is that option more appealing than an iPad Pro? Particularly a newer, larger screen, same form factor, smaller bezel iPad Pro? I am skeptical.</p>

			 <p>I do not think we should define a tablet as a screen without a keyboard, instead a tablet ought to be defined by how it is most commonly used, by which I mean you mostly use it in portrait orientation like one would a notepad of paper or a book.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a tablet has at least a 7-inch screen and is comfortable to hold and use for long periods of time with the device in a portriat orientation. Consequently devices that claim to be a tablet that have a 12-inch or larger screen are not really tablets, they really fall into a tweener (with notebooks), 2-in-1 category.</p>
<p>Based on how I use my iPad Pro 10.5, it is more a 2-in-1 because it is mostly used in landscape or when in portraint lying on a desk. By my defintion the only true tablets that I own are the iPad Mini 4 and the Nexus 9. The iPad and it&rsquo;s 9.7-inch screen is probably the largest screen size for a tablet.</p>
<p>My tablet use case definition might account for why tablets have not really overwhelmed the market. Apple had great initial success with the iPad, but sales started to taper off until the introduced the Pro line and significantly decreased the price of the regular iPad. The Pro line really fills the 2-in-1 market, while the lower price iPad has gained sales from holdouts who have wanted one the past but found them too expensive.</p>
<p>Further, by my defintion, the most successful tablet maker is likely Amazon with their cheap 7-inch and 8-inch tablets.</p>

			 <p>I have a hard time swallowing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17956202/google-pixel-3-price-expensive-why">the $150 price increase</a> between the Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel 3. I know Google can set prices the market will bear, but when I look at the difference I ask myself is the price increase due to higher costs or a desire for a higher profit margin?</p>
<p>Just about every Android phone that I have owned, from the original T-Mobile G1 to my current Pixel 2, has been either a Nexus or Made by Google phone because I value having the pure version of Android that is directly and quickly updated by Google. Having suffered during my Windows Mobile days of delayed software updates due to OEM timelines, I have tried to avoid such situations.</p>
<p>I want to keep using Pixel phones, Google seems to want to be in the premium priced smartphone market. What can be done? Google can follow Apple&rsquo;s lead into that premium market by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Continue to support older Pixel phones for several more future releases of Android. Google forced me to by a Pixel 2 because it announced Android 9 will not support the Nexus 6P, which I previously owned. In short Google should not continue only providing two operating system upgrades for their Pixel phones. The latest version of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-12/">iOS supports five generations</a> of iPhones and Android needs to do the same for Pixel phones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep selling at least two generations of Pixel phones and lower the price of the older generation. Right now the Pixel 2 is still available at the Google Store, but for how long? I think Google needs to keep selling the Pixel 2 until it announces the Pixel 4, which then builds in a lower priced Pixel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems clear to me that smartphone prices have gone up across the board because Apple increased the price of the iPhone. I don&rsquo;t like the iPhone prices either, but there is one big difference today between iPhone and Pixel. The iPhone you buy today will very likely be able to run the version of iOS released four years from now, so you don&rsquo;t need to buy a new iPhone in two years, you cannot say the same thing about Pixel.</p>
<p>The combination of the $150 price increase, Apple&rsquo;s practice to support older models of iPhones and selling older models at lower prices has me considering for the first time a switch to iPhone. I value the ability to receive updates direct from the source of the operating system.</p>
<p>I prefer Android smartphones and I don&rsquo;t want to switch, so I hope Google will make the changes I describe above. I also need to take a closer look at <a href="https://www.android.com/one/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxvbdBRC0ARIsAKmec9bTgjNYnJ15XF1F-mkVu7nflgaw0voIk5MP2xEAMm3dJTzgbDVSttgaAse-EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CJLe6oWB_N0CFYLewAodBBgKTA">Android One</a>, which may clean Android with updates from Google at a lower price. The bottom line is that Googe needs to know there is more to providing a premium phone than a price increase, and paying $800 for a phone that will only get operating system upgrades for two years makes no sense.</p>

			 <p>Looking back, it occurs to me that <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html">my analysis</a> of the Cub&rsquo;s performance in last year&rsquo;s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.</p>
<p>The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer&rsquo;s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.</p>

			 <p>The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.</p>
<p>On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.</p>
<p>For me the Cub&rsquo;s chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana&rsquo;s ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub&rsquo;s need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer&rsquo;s bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer&rsquo;s bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.</p>
<p>Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don&rsquo;t think Maddon will manage in such a manner.</p>

			 <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job.</p>
<p>Senators have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether a person is competent to be a Supreme Court justice and not just like the candidates. The Senators who supported Kavanaugh have failed their duty.</p>

			 <p>I think the smart watch market is fascinating. On one hand you have Apple, with one design and software innovation and on the other hand you have a multitude of watch designers producing a variety of different looking watches at different price points using comparatively mediocre Wear OS. It also highlights the advantage of designing your own chips because Wear OS has been constrained by slow chip development by Qualcomm.</p>
<p>BTW, if one is in the market for a Wear OS watch, wait until when watches with the new chips release later this year, early next. I know a number of new watches are being released to coincide with the new version of Wear OS coming next month, but I expect the new chip to provide better battery life and processing for the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.</p>
<p>In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web&rsquo;s permanence, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">European Union even has a law</a> in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.</p>
<p>If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.</p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html">Dave currently thinks</a> Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.</p>
<p>To Dave&rsquo;s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.</p>
<p>The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t get <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/03/after-nike-hires-colin-kaepern.html">the mindset of conservatives</a>. They say things like they want small government and want government out of people&rsquo;s lives and yet they want to dictate their beliefs to people with whom they disagree.</p>
<p>If America is about liberty, then one expressing that liberty by protesting is in fact a high form of patriotism.</p>
<p>Second, people need to understand that public displays of patriotism, which is what standing during a national anthem is, is done by non-democratic countries too. Such displays are not uniquely American. See above for what is uniquely American.</p>
<p>Finally, in my upbringing kneeling is a sign of reverence. One can make the argument that kneeling is even a higher display of respect than standing. If Colin and the other NFL players did something like turn their back, or lie down, or start break dancing THAT would be disrespectful.</p>
<p>Worse, what is most disrespectful to veterans is not voting. Actively working to prevent citizens from voting. Not challenging the President when he sends our military in to conflict. And not demanding that Congress uphold its constitutional responsibility to declare war. Wouldn&rsquo;t making sure every vet gets the physical and mental health care they need be a true sign of respect? What is more respectful, actually caring about active military and veterans or puttinng on appearances of respect?</p>
<p>P.S. Go to any sporting event and you will find people walking, talking, and otherwise not paying attention during the national anthem.</p>

			 <p>Apparently Google announced they will be releasing a new version of Wear OS within the next month. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-wear-os-updates-hint-at-fitness-smartwatches-to-come/">Articles are available</a> from several sources, all appearing pretty much the same. It would be nice to see a video of the changes, but apparently that has not been provided by Google.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been running the new version of Google Fit for four days, and I am pretty happy with the change. I had already made the mental shift from steps to move minutes. Fit has even suggested in an increase in my goals after using the defaults and monitoring my activity for a few days.</p>
<p>One problem that I do have with my watch, which is a Fossil Q Explorist, is that the battery life has been worse since upgrading my phone to Android P. I am not sure that is the exact correlation, but it feels to be the case. I&rsquo;ve had several occurrences of the battery running out on my watch by early evening, which was not an issue in the past.</p>

			 <p>I think of micro.blog as a publishing platform, for two reasons. First, what I write is published to <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my blog</a>. Second, what I write is published to other distribution channels, specifically for me <a href="https://twitter.com/frankm">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank">Facebook</a>, but it could also include Medium and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>What would make micro.blog perfect for me is the ability to designate, at the time I am writing, to which distribution channels I want a particular item published to. All things that I write are appropriate for my blog, but some things I might only want to also be published to Twitter and yet other things I would prefer published to Facebook.</p>
<p>To me, the ability to control what gets published where, from the app in which I am writing, is particularly important if I were to publish to the LinkedIn and Medium channels that could be considered more &ldquo;professional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right now, cross-posting is all or nothing. Everything I write in micro.blog is cross posted to Twitter and Facebook and frankly some posts, like this one, don&rsquo;t make sense for those audiences.</p>
<p>I recognize there are drawbacks to cross posting, specifically, it&rsquo;s a write once experience meaning that edits don&rsquo;t get re-published to Twitter and Facebook because there just isn&rsquo;t a mechanism to do so.</p>

			 <p>My first computer was the <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/ts1000.html">Timex Sinclair</a> 1000 that my grandmother gave me as a birthday present in 1983. I got that computer because it was cheap enough for my grandmother to buy, and she somehow determined back then that computers where the future.</p>
<p>One of the unique things about the TS1000 is that it had a membrane keyboard and each key had multiple functions, most notably certain function key combinations produced BASIC reserve words geared towards making it easy to learn how to program. The TS1000&rsquo;s keyboard could be seen today as a predecessor to today&rsquo;s on-screen keyboards.</p>
<p>Back in the 80s and early 90s all personal computers came with an operating system and the BASIC programming language. While you could buy some pre-packaged software, the most common way to add programs to a computer was by either writing yourself or by typing one that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2012/12/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/">printed in a magazine</a>.</p>
<p>The TS1000 was an educational computer and the forefather to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> that you can buy today for as little as $30. I have several Raspberry Pis that I tinker with, and I think parents ought to buy them for any child who is at all interested in studying computers.</p>

			 <p>Well, that was interesting. I updated my Pi3 with the latest release of Raspbian and then decided to clone my new Jekyll repo and edit <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/about/">the about page</a> on my Raspberry Pi. Just because I could. I committed and pushed the update to the repo and checked the about page on the new site, and the new edits did not appear. Went to the Netlify site, logged in, and found the deploy failed with some error relating to node. I think during deploy nodejs 8 was attempted to be installed and it failed.</p>
<p>Next, I tried a fresh re-deploy and selected clear cache and this time deployment was successful.</p>
<p>So, what I learned here is that it appears whenever Netlify sees and pulls an update from the repo it seems to rebuild the container/VM that is hosting the site that includes installing nodejs, installing ruby gems (Jekyll uses ruby) then does a Jekyll build and ultimately deploys the site from the site fielder.</p>

			 <p>Unlike most others here at micro.blog, I consider <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/">my micro.blog</a> as my blog. The reason is that I distinguish blogs from long form writing and publishing on the Internet. For me, a blog post is 1 to 3 paragraphs and written in about 15 minutes or less.</p>
<p>I blog to share a thought or something of interest to me, I write to formulate and share ideas.</p>
<p>When I set up my micro.blog account and associated a personal blog domain to it, I decided that I would use my then current blog, <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">Let&rsquo;s Be Frank</a>, for long form writing. The &ldquo;broad&rdquo; push to HTTPS is going to make that a problem because that blog is managed using an app written by Dave Winer called <a href="http://1999.io">1999.io</a>, and it has a lot of Javascript libraries that I don&rsquo;t think he is every going to convert to HTTPS.</p>

I recently <a href="https://www.baty.net/2018/back-to-netlify/">learned about Netlify from Jack Baty</a> and after checking out its web site, I determined it has much of what I was looking for: <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">low price</a>, easy HTTPS implementation, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Netlify does not provide a Content Management System, but it integrates with Github to provide continuous deployment, so you can use static site generators like Jekyll for publishing content. Since I have a little experience with Jekyll, I decided to try out Netlify by following <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/">their Jekyll tutorial</a> and it didn&rsquo;t take me long to get a site up and available via HTTPS.</p>
<p>The upside with the approach I have so far is that I can write and publish content from any device, particularly my iPad. All you really need to do is add a file in the proper naming format to the posts folder of your Github repository. I&rsquo;ve cloned the repository to Working Copy on my iPad and found a Drafts action that will save a new item to Working Copy and insert the proper header informatation that Jekyll requires.</p>
<p>Right now <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net">the new site</a> is very much a work in progress and there may be changes. Oh, and I am aware of the irony of me writing this post here but this is is where you know me and I am not a stickler to such self determined rules.</p>

			 <p>Too many people in the United States think our government will be overthrown by force when the reality is it is happening in just the opposite manner. The strong arguments against gun control in the U.S. is evidence of this, as the argument centers around needing to keep guns as protection against government oppression. The powers that be don&rsquo;t need to take guns away, they just need us to keep arguing about them, which fossilizes idealogy and keeps attention away from what is really happening.</p>
<p>The constitution enables authoritarianism when Congress and the Supreme Court do not function in their jobs as overseers of the Presidency. When Congress and the Supreme Court simply align with a president due to party affliation, you have a dictator in practice.</p>
<p>Today the process nearly complete, and gerrymandering will seal the deal. Gerrymandering removes the one power citizens have, which is to vote. You don&rsquo;t need to burn down the flag nor rip up the Constitution, all that is needed is idealogical compliance to what the Presidency wants.</p>

			 <p>Tolerance is fundamental to freedom. If we stop tolerating actions or opinions that we disagree with, you stop freedom, democracy disappears and is replaced by dictatorship. The irony is for the idea that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful and should not be tolerated, we are giving up the very freedom that too many gave their lives for.</p>
<p>You can not dictate respect. Dictating respect is counter to tolerance and is counterproductive because respect is earned, not given.</p>
<p>Do you really want freedom? If you do, it starts by tolerating those with whom you disagree and not treating them with contempt.</p>

			 <p>One thing I find frustrating about iOS are the number of apps that all seem to do the exact same thing. How do you decide on one over the other? An example is Drafts and Ulysses, both are good markdown editors but Drafts supports more automation. Last summer I was looking for a new editor and Ulysses came highly recommended, so I bought it, but then the company switched to a subscription model and that turned me off, I decided to not buy in to the subscription.</p>
<p>Then I learned about Drafts, and so I went and downloaded it and have used it to write some blog posts. To date I have mostly used it to write long posts for <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">one site</a> that only has a &ldquo;basic&rdquo; web-based editor. Of course, Drafts has now been recently upgraded and it too has a subscription model.</p>
<p>To me, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have Ulysses and Drafts on my iPad, Drafts seems to able to do the job good enough. However, so far I have not seen an Action for sending text to Wordpress, which I find a bit surprising. Does anyone know of such an Action? The one in the Drafts directory appears to require components not part of Wordpress.com.</p>

			 <p>You might think it too fine a point, but I think any blogging product requires the ability to edit what one has written. To me, editing is a fundamental difference between blogging and social networks because blogging is about permanence where as the social network timeline/newsfeed is a black hole.</p>
<p>To me, what makes micro blogging different from social networks like Twitter is the permance I describe above, and therefore editing should be a fundamental requirement for all micro blogging apps.</p>

			 <p>Google has released the new version of Gmail, which I am checking out. I have been using, and like, Inbox mostly because how quickly I can use it to triage email. By triage I mean browse for messages I want to read and then quickly archiving all the remaining messages. No other app, including Gmail provides as easy a way to archive a group of messages.</p>
<p>The downside of Inbox is that it is very JavaScript heavy and therefore the web app performance can suffer. Another downside is that the app versions don’t look as good on larger screens such as on my 10.5 iPad Pro in landscape.</p>
<p>So, I am considering using Gmail on large screens and Inbox on small screens. However to decide that, I need to use the new Gmail for a while.</p>

			 <p>Did a little more investigation into <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/04/22/i-got-a.html">the watch face that Fossil &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to my smart watch last weekend</a>. What happens is, you receive a notification saying that you &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; a face and whether you want to enable it. What I have found is that amongst the many faces that are pre-installed on the watch is one called Seasonal, and this is the face that Fossil pushes updates to. Consequently, Fossil is not consuming additional storage space on the watch with each &ldquo;new face&rdquo; as it is updating one face that is designed for different appearances, which in reality is how all faces work.</p>
<p>I am wondering whether there is a Wear OS app that will automatically change watch faces I specify on a set schedule. I would like to rotate through some like the Outlook face that I like to use during the work day.</p>

			 <p>What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising.</p>
<p>If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don&rsquo;t see how in any way that infringes on a person&rsquo;s free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person&rsquo;s ability to make money on cable TV.</p>
<p>Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/twenty-states-sue-federal-government-seeking-end-to-obamacare-idUSKCN1GB06R">Twenty states have filed suit</a> against the federal government basically because there is no business model in healthcare insurance. Before we can fix problems we have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agree on what is the problem</li>
<li>Agree that the problem needs to be fixed</li>
<li>Understand that the solution to every problem (healthcare) is not a hammer called capitalism</li>
<li>Agree on fundamental principles</li>
</ol>
<p>Fundamentally, the business model for insurance is based on the premise that a company pays out less money than it takes in through people buying insurance. Property insurance works because it is possible that people who pay for it never need to file a claim through their life time. Likewise auto insurance works because there are people who never have to file a claim over a lifetime of driving.</p>
<p>In context, there really is no such thing as health insurance because every health care transaction is paid by the &ldquo;health insurance&rdquo; companies and just about everyone has one or more healthcare transactions per year. In other words, how does a &ldquo;health insurance&rdquo; company make money? If auto insurance was like healthcare, ever time one took their car in for an oil change or a tire rotation they would file an auto insurance claim.</p>
<p>Basically, we have to stop thinking that there is a capitalistic solution to the cost of health care. Just about all other countries around the world came to this realization and did something about it. We in the United States have drunk the capitalistic koolaid so much that we have forgotten our own history and just run around trying to hammer away every single problem.</p>

			 <p>A couple of thoughts about OmniFocus after reading <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018">Omni&rsquo;s roadmap for 2018</a>.
As an iOS user but not a Mac OS user, I have long heard about OmniFocus and how great it is but never tried it out. A few weeks ago I discovered I could install the iOS version and try it out for free for two weeks, which I did and frankly, it didn&rsquo;t seem much better than Todoist or 2Do.</p>
<p>My main requirement is multi-platform support because while use an iPad as my primary personal computer, I  also use Android smartphones and Windows notebook computers. The inability to get to info in OmniFocus from Windows has been a show stopper, and web access, which is on the roadmap, will help, however I am concerned about the &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; plan.</p>
<p>A simple way that Omni could solve this problem is by syncing with Toodledo. While there is a Toodledo iOS app, it is not very efficient so I use 2Do on my iPad that syncs my data with Toodledo. The benefit is that there are Toodledo apps for other platforms, and the Toodledo web app is one of the most advanced web apps that I use.</p>
<p>I am also surprised that OmniFocus doesn&rsquo;t use an outliner for editing projects and tasks, given the existence of OmniOutliner, which I do use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep a watch out for the next release of OmniFocus and probably check it out.</p>

<p>One might not agree with the entire premise of the above article, but I think there is something to the point being made that we wrongly think markets/capitalism is the solution to every problem in our country. In fact, one can make the argument that capitalism is the root of much that is wrong in our country.</p>
<p>For example, the reality is capitalism (read revenue and profits) is the true reason why the NRA agressively opposes any gun control; the NRA&rsquo;s corporate supporters make a lot of money off the sale of guns and ammunition and logically do not want any of that money to be at risk. Just like capitalism drove the tobacco industry to ignore studies showing smoking causes cancer.</p>
<p>For a long time I have been saying that we tend to confuse capitalism with democracy. I think this is reflected most prominently by the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/">Citizens United</a> SCOTUS ruling that says corporate spending on politics is a form of free speech, and thus corporations have a right to free speech.</p>
<p>Corporations are a construct of capitalism, they are not in themselves men or women of any race. In otherwords, corporations are not citizens.</p>
<p>Citizens United may be the worst SCOTUS ruling of my lifetime. Worse, it is reflects a flawed understanding that frankly skews society in favor of corporations and the oligarchs that profit from them.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of the year and therefore the time for my yearly ritual of trying to find a to-do (task management) app that I like and think that I will use. I am again finding myself with <a href="http://www.toodledo.com">Toodledo</a>, mostly because it has more filtering features that other apps and because it has a robust web app. However, Toodledo does not have a robust iOS app.</p>
<p>The Toodledo iOS app does the job but doesn&rsquo;t have the best UI. However, I have found that 2Do syns with Toodledo so I am giving that a try. At worst I can toggle between the two apps because they sync with the same data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, 2Do does not sync Toodledo&rsquo;s statuses, so if I want the same functionality I need to create tags rather that statuses.</p>

			 <p>Later today Michigan Tech will play Bowling Green in the championship game of the 53rd Great Lakes Invitational hockey tournament. It is the first GLi at the new Little Caesars&rsquo;s Arena and is hosted by Michigan Tech.</p>
<p>Either of the potential opponents for Tech in the championship presented interesting story lines. Had Michigan won Tech would be facing their former coach, Mel Pearson, who just left his Alma mater to become Michigan&rsquo;s head coach. Tech&rsquo;s return to college hockey prominence started when Pearson took the helm.</p>
<p>Pearson&rsquo;s last game as Tech&rsquo;s head coach was the 2017 WCHA championship game in which <a href="http://www.wcha.com/men/pres1617/201703/mar12wcm.php">the Huskies beat Bowling Green</a> to take the Broadmore Trophy and the NCAA tourney bid. What better way for the Falcons to gain revenge for that loss than by beating Tech in their tournament in the new arena and carry home the MacInnes Cup, named for legendary Tech coach <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_MacInnes">John MacInnes</a>?</p>

<p>If we think deeply about the consequences of debt you see meaning. Holding debt over a person is to have power over that person. The person in debt therefore is more or less a slave to the person (or thing) that has power over them. One of the earliest themes of what Jesus did for us was to set us free.</p>
<p>As we in the United Stated look more and more like the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi">Ferengie</a> every day, it may be helpful to replace the word &ldquo;sin&rdquo; with &ldquo;debt&rdquo; more often.</p>

			 <p>I got a Raspberry Pi Zero W for Christmas that I am setting up, and so far not having much luck getting the OS to install. I think the file transfer is taking too long. I am regretting following the instructions literally, meaning I installed the Pi Zero in the case and there isn&rsquo;t an easy way to remove the micro SD card without removing them Zero entirely.</p>
<p>Looks like I will have to remove the Zero and flash the card with a complete build on a PC. I hope that  I can get the Zero out of he case without breaking it.</p>

<p>Apparently, when something I ordered is delivered to the locker, I will get an email with a six digit code that I then use at the locker location to retrieve my package. I have three days to pick up the package otherwise it will be returned for refund. Perhaps best of all, lockers can be used as a drop off location for returns.</p>
<p>Given the rise in people having deliveries stolen, I can see these lockers becoming useful for valuable items being shipped for which you may not be hope to sign for.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Despite scientific research and Congressional hearings, the NFL is still not serious about the safety of its players due to concussions. In fact, the current NFL rules <strong>rewards</strong> teams of players who inflict a concussion.</p>
<p>The latest example occurred during the Packers and Panthers game on December 17. During the game Panther Thomas Davis launched into Davante Adams resulting in Adams being removed for the game due to the obvious helmet-on-helmet hit. A personal foul was called on Davis, but he remained in the game while the Packers lost one of their most important players.</p>
<p>Players who may be concussed must be removed from play until doctors confirm it is ok for him to return. In this case, the right thing happened while that has not always been the case. However, how is it that the player causing the injury, unnecessarily, is still allowed to play?</p>
<p>Treating concussions is important but equally important is preventing concussions from happening in the first place, and that will not happen without immediate and significant enforcement on the field. All direct hits to the head should result in an immediate ejection, and this rule should be enforced not only by on field officials but also by replay. At a minimum the NFL ought to have a booth review, as is the case with the NCAA, but I favor the booth being able to eject such players at any time.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the current approach of only reviewing and penalizing such plays after the game is over is not sufficient in deterring such hits and violates the spirit of the game. The life time health of the players demands extreme action. If the NFL is unable to police itself then Congress must step in with regulation. Right now it appears profits are outweighing safety.</p>
