         	<p>Note that with micro.blog, everything I post is cross-posted to Twitter. With Drummer I can select <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/2021/10/15.html#a130231">specific posts</a> to cross-post to Twitter. At this point I am not sure if one way is significantly better than the other. What I really want is an application that acts for me like a switchboard where I can specific to which channels I want an item posted. I can post to micro.blog from eternal apps, but there is no API with Old School to enable the same. Those who read Dave should see some irony in this fact.</p>

         	<p>Dave has provided code to publish content you write in Drummer to an AWS S3 bucket.

         	<p>The first phone running Android sold in the United States was the T-Mobile G1, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when+did+the+t-mobile+g1+come+out&amp;oq=when+did+the+t-mobile+g1+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j33i160l2j33i299.11087j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">first sold on October 22, 2008</a>. The HTC version began selling a month earlier. I bought the phone shortly after launch and I am surprised that I did not write about the initial purchase. My <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2008/11/23/g1-catch-up/">first blog post about the G1 and Android</a> was on November 23, 2008.</p>

         	<p>To me <a href="http://drummer.scripting.com">Drummer</a> is the next version of <a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>, but that is only relevant to people like me who used Fargo. One enters and manages content in an outline, which has the same UI as <a href="http://littleoutliner.com">Little Outliner</a>. One can use Drummer to create and maintain a blog that is generated (published) based on a OPML file and a CSS, Javascript and HTML template. Hosting of the front end Editor and backed publisher and web content is currently being provided by Dave Winer, who is the application developer.</p>

<p>One can associate a unique URL to the location where the generated blog content is stored using <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/11/135025.html?title=pageparkBuildsAgain">PagePark</a>. In this instance PagePark is basically acting as a reverse proxy, none of your content is stored on your own server.</p>

<p>Dave does provide Mac version of the Drummer front end that is based on Electron. He may provide Windows and Linux versions of the app. The Electron version of the app will enable you to store and edit your source content OPML files on your own computer, but from what I can tell the published content will still be hosted on Dave&rsquo;s server.</p>

<p>From what I have read, the desktop version of Drummer is intended to be near to or equal to the OPML Editor. For my purposes it is most desirable to have the desktop version of this application.</p>

<p>Final note, a check of the source to the HTML file of the blog shows that nearly all of the &ldquo;script src&rdquo; tags have been changed and it looks like if one hosts PagePark on a server/container that supports HTTPS you might have success in accessing the blog via HTTPs.</p>

<p>My Drummer blog is at <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/.">oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/.</a></p>

         	<p>I will try <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/07.html">Drummer</a>. Two things I am interested to learn, one is how is the backend hosting handled the other is the level of integration with Radio3.  I do think it&rsquo;s disappointing that this is another, new blogging platform that does not support HTTPS. While theew is the appearance of fighting &ldquo;the man&rdquo; (Google) the reality is soon it will become harder for users to read what is published to this platform because ALL major browsers will make it harder for users to access sites that don&rsquo;t use HTTPS. The sad thing is that at this point it is much easier to support HTTPS so don&rsquo;t real there is a real good excuse for not doing it.</p>

         	<p>In my opinion the root cause to the problems that <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/10/05/135513.html?title=facebookIsUs">Facebook</a> exposes is the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/3/11628554/commercialization-is-the-greatest-threat-to-the-internet-survey-finds">commercialization of the Internet</a>.

<p>The fast majority of the problems we are dealing with in the United States has been due to a war waged by powers and principalities against <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/new-deal-programs-still-in-effect-today-4154043">the New Deal laws</a> that constrain capitalism and preserve democracy.</p>

         	<p>Happy <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">Windows 11 day</a>! I&rsquo;ve spent the last several days experimenting with the ARM Version of Windows 11 on a Raspberry Pi 4. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-windows-11-raspberry-pi">The installation process</a> is pretty easy thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/Botspot/wor-flasher">WoR-Flasher</a> utility, which I used to &ldquo;burn&rdquo; an installation image to a SSD. At first I tried installing by simply using USB drive, and while that worked I wondered whether using a SSD would be better. I ended up buying an inexpensive Crucial SSD and a 3.1 USB enclosure, which isn&rsquo;t going to be as fast a direct PCIe connection, but the combo does time out faster than the thumb drive. One challenge I had was making sure the power adapter of the Pi was providing enough power for the drive, which I resolved once I used <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-power-supply.html">the 3.5A USB C power adapter from CanaKit</a>. One constraint is that the Windows 11 build does not work with the Pi 4&rsquo;s WiFi. I don&rsquo;t know how long this version of Windows 11 will last, from what I read the update process is not smooth and may require a re-build, which will wipe out a product activation.</p>

<p>During this process I learned about differences between SATA and NVME SSD drives and found a really helpful <a href="https://jamesachambers.com/new-raspberry-pi-4-bootloader-usb-network-boot-guide/">guide about the Pi 4 bootloader and USB mass storage</a>. I also found a very extensive <a href="https://pibenchmarks.com/">site of performance benchmarks</a> of mass storage connected to Raspberry Pis.</p>

         	<p>Found the reason for why the Chrome OS Files app on my Pixelbook was taking so long to load the file system. There were SMB share mappings that became corrupt and basically Files was trying to access those shares but would eventually time out. Unfortunately, the corruption prevented me from removing the shares via the UI and there is no known way to manually remove them, so I had to powerwash the Pixelbook.</p>

<p>Powerwash restores Chromebooks to their factory default state, and because all of the apps and settings for Chromebooks are in the cloud, the restore process is pretty quick, even with Android apps installed. If you do have Linux apps installed, which I do, that does require a traditional backup and restore, but restoring a container such as Chrome OS uses for Linux makes that restore process pretty quick and straightforward.</p>

<p>My personal experience with this process confirms to me why Chromebooks are so popular with schools, the restore process for them is probably the easiest and fastest of any device you can put your hands on.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Back when there were several book store chains and plenty of stores I spent a fair amount of time in them and in particular looking through the computer magazine section. Magazines were a big part of my formative computing years, and I looked forward to each month&rsquo;s issue of <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine">Byte</a>. The magazines were not only a source of news about the latest hardware and software, they were also a means of software distribution containing pages of source code available to manually enter on a variety of computer platforms.</p>

<p>Physical book stores are nearly extinct and computer magazines shrank in to oblivion, replaced by the Internet, but I have found one corner of the Internet where computer magazines still live. You may have heard of the Raspberry Pi, which is an inexpensive &ldquo;computer on a chip&rdquo;  popular amongst makers. What you might not know is that raspberrypi.org is more than just the computer hardware, it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/">foundation dedicated towards computer education</a>. The foundation publishes tutorials and lesson plans for teachers and it has a publishing arm for books and magazines.</p>

<p>Four different magazines are <a href="https://store.rpipress.cc">published</a>: HackSpace, Custom PC, Wireframe, and The MagPi, which you can subscribe to and purchase online and in stores in the United Kingdom. Better yet, the magazines and books are free to download in PDF format.</p>

<p>If you own a Raspberry Pi and have the full desktop version of the operating system installed you will find a Bookshelf app in the Help menu of the desktop&rsquo;s application launcher. Bookshelf has tabs for each magazine and books that you can download and read on the Pi.  If you don&rsquo;t have a Pi you can <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/books-magazines/">browse through and download the PDFS</a> using the web browser on your computer.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Raspberry Pi you will find everything you need to know about it on their web site, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberrypi.org</a>.  Another great source for information is the <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/books/handbook-2022">Official Raspberry Pi Handbook</a>, and the 2022 version has been just released and available to download.</p>

<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive starter computer for yourself or a child, I recommend <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/">the Raspberry Pi 400</a>, which is an &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; computer you can buy for $70. I also think anyone considering a future in computing, or just interested to learn more, should buy a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> kit, which you can assemble and use to learn more about computer hardware and software.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am contemplating purchasing a new laptop computer so that I can access and learn the latest operating systems. I am most interested in Window 11 because Windows is the primary operating system that I use every work day, but <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/11/how-universal-control-on-ipados-15-and-macos-12-works">the integrations</a> between iPadOS and MacOS also have me interested in a Mac. If I buy a Mac I can also <a href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/windows11/">run Windows 11 in a VM</a>, so that will provide me the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>So, I watched the Microsoft Event today to see whether Microsoft might announce something that will influence my purchase decision. My conclusion is none of the products announced today fit in the budget that I have in mind because of the add-ons one has to purchase to gain full functionality.</p>

<p>Microsoft did announce nice looking products today, but for me they have a real pricing problem. Take, for example, the new Surface Go 3. The lowest price version costs $399, which comes with 4 GB of RAM and only 64 GB of storage, which I really do not think is enough storage for any productivity device in 2021. Consequently, the lowest model I would consider is the mid-tier 8 GB RAM, 128 GB model at $549, but that only gets you the tablet. You will want to add a type cover that costs at least $100 and most likely a Surface Pen for another $70, for a grand total of $719, and that combo is with an Intel Pentium processor rather than the more powerful Intel Core i5 in the Surface Laptop Go. In my opinion Microsoft should include the type keyboard with the Surface Pro and Surface Go at their current price.</p>

<p>My research prior to the event tells me that the Microsoft product that most makes sense for a reasonable PC running Windows 11 is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-go/94fc0bdgq7wv?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Surface Laptop Go</a>. While it won&rsquo;t run MacOS, you can buy a well equipped model (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) for $800.</p>

<p>Thing is, I can also buy a <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac Mini</a> with the same memory, storage, and price and for less than $200 also have the ability to run Windows 11. Of course, the Mini is a desktop and my bias is toward the portability of a laptop, so that has me looking at a Macbook Air for $200 more, which is pushing the price a bit higher than I would like.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t intend to make a decision until after the expected Apple Mac event that should happen in October. Rumors are a new Mac Mini and Macbook Pros will be announced, but not an Air. A new Macbook Pro might influence pricing of the current Airs. My ideal would be a new entry level Pro with 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSD starting at the current $1299 &ldquo;base&rdquo; price, which I think would mean Apple could drop the price of the current Airs by $100 to $200. The logic being it would not make sense to have the high end Air and the Low end Pro with the same specs and same price because nobody would by the high end Air. (The only reason to buy the high end Air over the Pro right now is the 512 GB storage at $50 less price!)</p>

<p>The other question is, what will be the specs for the new Mac Minis? In this case I expect the specs will remain the same, the prices will remain the same, and there will be a processor upgrade. However, the consequence there might be availability of the current Mac Minis at lower prices. An 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD model at nearly $600 is appealing.</p>

<p>One might think the reasoning I&rsquo;ve described above is an &ldquo;apples to oranges&rdquo; comparison. I see it as a &ldquo;get what I need&rdquo; versus an &ldquo;investment&rdquo; comparison. I bought my last Macbook Air 15 years ago, and it still functions! It&rsquo;s really slow compared to most devices today, but what that experience tells me is that buying an Apple laptop or desktop realistically gets me 5 to 7 years of use. I can buy a cheaper laptop to just run Windows 11 but it probably gets me 4 years of real use.</p>

<p>So, now we wait for the next Apple event. Traditionally Apple has held two events in the fall, one in September to announce new iPhones, which they did, and one in October featuring Macs and iPads, thus one more event to gather information for making my purchase decision.</p>

         	<p>The Quick Notes feature with iPadOS 15 not only provides a way to quickly create a note, but it also links notes to apps if they are set up for it. An example, when I open this site in Safari on my iPad the note that contains the link of this site pops up as a thumbnail at the lower right and it goes away when I scroll the page. I am creating scratch note of ideas related to this blog. So far I&rsquo;ve found that I can also link a note to a list in Things.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>And here you thought pumpkin spice was for fall, no it&rsquo;s operating system season! Yesterday Apple released <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/">iOS and iPadOS Version 15</a>, and coming up October is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android Version 12</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">Windows 11</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/">MacOS Monterey</a>. Three companies (Apple, Google, Microsoft) and three platforms (smartphone, tablets, desktop/laptop).</p>

<p>I installed iPadOS Version 15 on my iPad Mini yesterday and I haven&rsquo;t spent a significant enough time with it yet. So far it&rsquo;s a mixed bag. For example, being able to place widgets on the home screen makes them a bunch more useful, but the tradeoff is a decrease in the number of icons per line that display. My old iPad Mini has a quarter inch bezel followed by a half inch of empty space on the left and right side of the screen. I fear this is going to look worse on the iPad Air.</p>

<p>Of course, iPhone owners have had widgets and App Library since last year, so this is not new to them. I don&rsquo;t own an iPhone, but so far I wonder whether they see much new in this version of iOS.</p>

<p>For some reason I like how the App Library flys up from the lower right of the screen. I do think App Library is a better way to manage applications than has existed prior, just wish I could edit what Apple does automatically to tailor the result. I suspect the larger icons in each group were determined to be the most frequently used app of that group, do they change over time?</p>

<p>The changes of widgets and App Library create questions of what icons to place on the home screen if any, given the dock. Tapping the widgets launches the associated app, so they serve that purpose in addition to providing information. I probably don&rsquo;t need any icons but so far I have kept six: Mail, Safari, Streaks, Notes, NetNewsWire and Pocket. Another decision is, what to do with the &ldquo;old page&rdquo; that displays when you swipe right from the left edge? The widgets on the home screen don&rsquo;t need to also be there, so there is some changes to be made.</p>

<p>What else? I know the changes to how multitasking works is significant, but I won&rsquo;t fully experience that until I upgrade the iPad Air. This is the fun of operating system season, discovering new &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; and hoping they aren&rsquo;t lumps of coal.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>British inventor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clive-sinclair-dead-obituary-212309487.html?src=rss&amp;utm_source=pocket_mylist">Sir Clive Sinclair died yesterday, September 16</a>. I, of course, never met this man who had an impact on the direction of my life.</p>

<p>My chosen field of study in college, computer science, led to the career that caused me to move to metropolitan Detroit, ultimately meet and marry my wife, and have the life I now live. How I came to chose to study computer science was influenced by three events during my high school years: the arrival of the Apple II in my high school, taking an after school BASIC programming class, and being gifted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000">the Timex Sinclair 1000</a>. Sir Sinclair invented the ZX80, the predecessor to the ZX8, in Britian, and that same computer was later sold as the Timex Sinclair 1000 in the United States.</p>

<p>I was raised by my grandmother and we lived off social security along with some savings. The personal computers sold at the time cost well beyond our means, but the Timex Sinclair only cost $100, though you needed the nearly $40 additional cost of the 16 KB storage for it to be useful. The nearly $150 total cost made it the most expensive gift my grandmother ever bought me, and I don&rsquo;t doubt she made sacrifices to buy it, but she felt it important for my future. Turns out my grandmother was right.</p>

<p>Even by the standards of the time, the Timex Sinclair was a bit of a joke for a computer. Frogger was one of the games available for the Timex Sinclair that my friend called &ldquo;woodtick&rdquo; because of how the large block pixel graphics of the frog took over the entire TV screen when it got run over by a car.</p>

<p>Back then the common display for personal computers were TV screens. Programs were stored on cassete tapes. As I said, the Timex Sinclair only had 16 kilobytes of RAM. It had a membrane keyboard rather than a real keyboard that had most of the BASIC functions assigned. When writing a program you &ldquo;typed&rdquo; PRINT by pressing a combination of a function key and they key that had the command printed on it. I don&rsquo;t recall whether I ever connected the Timex Sinclair to a printer or did anything like word processing.</p>

<p>Despite the limits Sinclair&rsquo;s invention made a brand new world of personal computing accessible to me in the comfort of my bedroom floor. Hours of typing in pre-printed programs from magazines and hours of experimenting with little BASIC programs sparked the interest that as I said led to the life I now have.</p>

<p>Reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/17/clive-sinclair-zx-spectrum-offbeat-brilliance?utm_source=pocket_mylist">tributes and stories</a> of Sinclair, I know that I am just one of hundreds of thousands of people around the world that share the same story. What a wonderful legacy. Thank you Sir Sinclair, rest in peace.</p>

         	<p>It seems to me that the real argument occuring in the United States is between when one&rsquo;s rights affect the rights of others, which one is given priority? If you look at every problem in the U.S. it comes back to a belief that what matters most is individual rights, even when the exercise thereof impedes upon that same right of another.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Twenty years ago today, a Sikh father was murdered in front of his gas station in Mesa, Arizona by a man who called himself a patriot. Balbir Singh Sodhi was the first person killed in thousands of acts of hate in the aftermath of 9/11. Since his murder, countless lives have been lost or shattered by the way our nation responded to 9/11 — in decades of war, torture, surveillance, deportations, detentions, and hate violence that continues today.</p>

<p>Balbir Singh Sodhi was a kind-hearted and generous man, whom many called “Uncle.” He would give candy to children who came to his gas station as if they were his own children. He let people who didn’t have money for gas fill up and go. His brothers would shake their heads in disbelief. Was he a saint or a fool? But Balbir Uncle would just smile, saying God wants us to serve all. He and his brothers had come to America to escape religious persecution against Sikhs in India. He was planting flowers in front of his gas station when he was shot in the back, targeted for his turban.</p>

<p>Balbir Uncle wore his turban as part of his faith — his commitment to love all of humanity. What if we made the vision that he died for our North Star? What would the world look like if we valued human dignity above all? What if we chose, like Balbir Uncle, to treat all as family, to see no stranger? How would we be remembered 20 years from now? #BalbirSodhi #20YearsSince</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve listened to <a href="https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/michael-wolff-on-the-trump-threat">Andrew Sullivan&rsquo;s interview with Michael Wolff</a>, who has written three books about the Trump presidency. Wolff&rsquo;s assessment of Trump is straightforward, he believes Trump is crazy and thus not competent to be a real threat to Democracy. I think Wolff is being too myopic in his assessment, a Trump presidency is not the same as Trump the man. Trump the man is a mark for those in power and that makes a Trump presidency dangerous. Another Trump presidency is dangerous for how it will be used by those who Trump thinks is an ally.</p>

         	<p>In my feeds this morning are some statements recalling how united they thought we were on 9/12/2001 and wishing that was the same today. A deeper, perhaps more meaningful question might be, why is it that the United States can only unite around hatred for an external enemy?</p>

<p>Some thought, many hoped, back then that the event would be a catalyst for change. Of course change is always happening, transformation is what is really desired. The difference is between what naturally happens and intent. Transformation requires true understanding of from what to what, which in turn requires a desire to look within.</p>

<p>Take for example the pandemic. Much of the struggle amongst ourselves is superficial. Wear a mask, don&rsquo;t wear a mask. Get the vaccine, I&rsquo;ll never get the vaccine. Our attention is on these arguments with little thought about why the arguments are even happening.</p>

<p>For me what the pandemic exposes, and what has existed from well before 9/11, is a majority of people stuck within the basic animal instinct to view everything and everyone by comparison. Either you&rsquo;re or with me or you&rsquo;re against me is one of our most basic survival instincts. While this instinct keeps us alive in a moment of crisis, living constantly in this mode prevents one from growing and usually makes us vulnerable to being manipulated in to decisions not in our long term best interests.</p>

<p>The transformation some of us desired after 9/11 that would have resulted in more unity did not happen because there was no intention for it to happen. Change, yes, that has happened, we have evolved to a more fractured not united state than before, and will apparently continue to do so unless we intentionally chose a different path.</p>

<p>The United States of America is only 245 years old. In comparison to the world, the U.S. is a toddler, to the universe, an infant. Our growth (transformation) relies in embracing the seemingly conflicting values of liberty and unity, by transformation from an either/or worldview to a both/and worldview. The transformation will not be easy because everything we know and see around us is built on and reinforces either/or. Either/or keeps power in power. <a href="https://youtu.be/zE7PKRjrid4">Take the red pill</a></p>

         	<p>&ldquo;Yet it is the peculiar genius of our society that its rulers have figured out a way, as in the case of the fish-fryers, to ensure that rage is directed precisely against those who actually do get to do meaningful work. For instance: in our society, there seems a general rule that, the more obviously one&rsquo;s work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One lesson we should learn from the pandemic is that we did once recognize there is a class of worked deemed essential, and these people who do that work deserve our respect and the ability to earn a living.</p>

         	<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781444791709">In the Shelter: Finding a Home in the World</a> by Pádraig Ó Tuama 📚</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this book because it contains so much wisdom scavenged during life lived. Chapter 8, Hello To Change, is particularly good with the following standing out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For many, the possibility of being wrong is a threat to the foundations of thought, morality, or empire. And without a doubt, those who advocate scientific thought are as prone as other schools of thought to being superior. But written into the heart of science is the embrace of the gift of being wrong.&rdquo; page 197 (I would add, due to my current political mindset, that in a similar way written into the heart of democracy is the embrace of the possibility of losing an election. I see a common denominator between the emergent anti-science and anti-democracy ideaologies.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Greek word translated into English as “repentance” is metanoia. The prefix meta means “beyond,” hence metaphysics being the study of—or speculation about—what is beyond the natural. The word noia means “thought” or “mind.” Together, however, metanoia means to change your thoughts, to change your mind, to turn in a new direction, to reverse a direction and go a different way&rdquo; page 198</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>Technically, then, this should mean that the Christian faith is a faith that is adapted to change, a faith that is not undone by realizing that its precepts or propositions are incorrect.</strong>&rdquo; page 198, empahsis mine.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/08/20/after-using-android.html">After Using Android 12 For One Week</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/08/20/after-using-android.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-08-20 17:32:46 -0400">Aug 20, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A little over a week ago I installed <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes">beta 4</a> of Android 12 on my Google Pixel 4a. I have not experienced any significant issues with running this version of Android, even though it is still a true beta and not a release candidate.</p>

<p>Like most men, I imagine, I carry my phone in my front pants pocket. In the past I occasionally discovered that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-on-flashlight-on-android">the flashlight feature</a> of the phone turned on while the phone is in my pocket, causing an odd, if not humorous, appearance. After installing Android 12 I found this occurring much too frequently.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7443425?hl=en">Two lock screen settings</a> appear to be the culprits: Tap to check phone and lift to check phone. Movement while walking is being interpreted by Android as either a tap or a lift, so I have disabled both features. I notice that Android seems to be smart enough to know the phone is in my pocket because it turns off the ambient display, so it should also disable the tap and lift to check functions, and I have provided feedback on this to Google.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/689828/how-to-disable-or-enable-app-suggestions-on-a-pixel/">App suggestions</a>, which many people do not like and probably disable, are not working. Google added this feature in Android 11 that changes which app icons appear in the dock at the bottom of the home screen and at the top of the app drawer with the ones most commonly used at a particular time of day. Right now the icons displaying are the ones that were present in the dock at the time I installed the upgrade and have never been changed by Android. I might be the only person who likes this feature enough to report it not working.</p>

<p>I like the changes to the UI that Google has made, particularly increasing the font size in settings. The changes to the notifications are nice, although I am not sure whether I am a fan of the increased size of the Quick Settings icons, I think I wish they were the same as in Android 11.</p>

<p>Of course, the big change in Android 12 is the new design language called <a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you">Material You</a> with includes automatically changing the overall color appearance to the wallpaper on the phone. I have the Landscapes wallpaper changing daily to see changes with the appearance of the phone, and I am pretty pleased with what I am seeing.</p>

<p>I have not noticed any significant difference with over all performance or battery life, which is good. Ideally we would get better battery life in each release, but at the least we don&rsquo;t want to lose battery life.
Beta 4 marks Android 12 reaching the platform stability phase, which marks it as feature and API complete so that developers can test against a reliable version. One more release, release candidate one, will be made available before the final release of Android 12.</p>

<p>Android 11 was released on September 8, 2020, if Google is to meet that same early September release date we should see the release candidate late next week, which might coincide with the launch of the Pixel 5a.</p>

         	<p>It seems to happen over and over again. I read about a <a href="https://glass.photo/">new app</a>, so I click the link (assuming the author of whatever I am reading provides a link) and usually see two things that turn me off. First, the app only runs on one platform, often iOS or MacOS. Next the app has some type of subscription fee. Both are significant constraints, either I can&rsquo;t run the app or I can&rsquo;t afford to pay for the app.</p>

<p>The subscription pricing model is the most out of control. No more pay once for a version that you can use as long as one wished. Worse, are monthly subscriptions that add up to paying $100 or more per year. I get the allure for the sellers but how much in total money do these developers think people are willing to pay?</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Google Wear OS is a hot mess. During Google I/O earlier this year I got the impression that due to the partnership between Google and Samsung the pending Galaxy Watch 4 would be more in line with standard Wear OS watches. Given that it appears the Samsung watches will be the only ones to get Wear OS 3 this year, I was considering buying one.</p>

<p>However, as I read more reviews about the Galaxy watches I am becoming less likely to buy one. <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-is-missing-this-killer-feature-at-launch">First I read</a> that Google Assistant is not preinstalled. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/11/galaxy-watch-4-pairing-process-wear-os/">Next I read</a> that the watches don&rsquo;t easily pair with non-Samsung phones, nor work the the Android Wear OS app.</p>

<p>Amazingly, it looks like there will not be a serious Wear OS watch to buy in 2021, and there wasn&rsquo;t one last year. It feels like Google has or should just give up. As the Fossil Sport I have been wearing is getting more finicky, I am contemplating my next step. Buy a <a href="https://www.mobvoi.com/us/pages/ticwatche3">Mobvoi</a> that is expected to be the first to get Wear OS 3 next year, or dump Wear OS altogether and buy a Fitbit?</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s worse are suggestions that Wear OS 3 may not work best on the Qualcomm 4100 chip in the Mobvoi, the chip that is the next generation smart watch chip from Qualcomm. What the heck?</p>

<p>Hot mess indeed</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Yesterday Google released the final user beta for Android 12, and as I did since version 10, I have installed it on my <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/pixel-4a">Pixel 4a</a>. First thing I looked for is how the new UI colors and fonts look and I found that to really see that you need to be in light mode rather than dark mode. I&rsquo;ve been using dark mode full time with <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/android-11">Android 11</a>.</p>

<p>I did the update late last night so one of the new features I experienced first is the update to the ambient display, the larger clock display is handy at night when I wake up and want to see the time.</p>

<p>I think I like the changes to the notification shade but the larger quick setting buttons look off. Everything in the UI seems larger, which I appreciate.</p>

<p>One other change I looked forward to is the use of the power button to activate Google Assistant, which you have to specifically configure in settings. I disable &ldquo;Hey Google&rdquo; mostly to save battery life, but also because I find I don&rsquo;t use it very much. Wish Google would add a gesture to the fingerprint scanner in which if I press and hold the phone would unlock and activate Assistant. If I just tap the scanner the unlock the phone, if I keep my finger in the scanner then unlock and activate assistant.</p>

What I will remember from these Olympics, however, is how dangerous is gymnastics. Too much was written about Simone Biles’ “mental health” in a way suggesting what she was experiencing was “just” emotions. The problem was much more dire, the alignment of brain and body so that she lands on her feet and not her head.</p>

<p>Humans are not cats. Search for why cats land on their feet. If you ever had vertigo or just got dizzy, imagine that disorientation while spinning upside down ten feet in the air.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/08/05.html#a125406">Dave Winer is contemplating</a> how to support tools for thought on small screen devices like smartphones.</p>

<p>The lesson learned since Personal Digital Assistants and later smartphones first appeared is that screen size matters. Small screen, defined as less than seven inches,
use case is different from large screen size, a fact that Microsoft was unwilling to embrace.</p>

<p>For me, tools for thought on small screens should be optimized for the following use cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Data capture via the Operating System&rsquo;s sharing functionality so that I can easily and quickly capture information from other applications. One of the main reasons why I continue using Evernote is that it supports capturing information via mobile OS sharing functions and browser web clipping.</li>
<li>Fast and easy search to retrieve information that I store in my tools for thought. Again, I find Evernote does a good job here not only by an included search function but also via shortcuts that enable me to quickly retrieve information.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t often write on my smartphone. If the tool supports the OS sharing functionality then any app could be used for input and then sent in to the tool for thought, which is the model that Drafts is optimized for on iOS. If the app is for writing then a blank page is easiest for input, any type of outlining structure is difficult to manage on a small screen.</li>

I&rsquo;ve not had a single performance issue with the $349 Pixel 4a that I am currently using.</p>

<p>The big question Google is facing is, does the smartphone market have room for a third luxury, high priced, smartphone? Seems to me that people who buy for status buy iPhones or Samsung and I am not convinced they are going to choose Pixel 6 over either.</p>

The bad news is that the Delta variant is more contagious.</p>

<p>We need to change the focus on COVID from death rates to other measures that show the impact of the continuing spread. COVID still can have significant impacts even when ti doesn&rsquo;t kill you, and we need to put the focus on that. Too many still think COVID is nothing more than a cold, or at worst case the flu.</p>

         	<p>Dave has <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/07/28.html#a144850">a feature on Scripting News</a> that he calls tagging, which is basically a reference to all the writing on his site that includes that tag. It&rsquo;s a similar concept to how Roam, Logseq, and Obsidian use what I call wiki links that not only link to an internal page but also show all places where that page is referenced.</p>

<p>The problem for me is that Dave is using an editing construct in a published form. In my opinion in a published HTML page, a hyperlink is a hyperlink is a hyperlink. Wiki does have the concept of providing an indicator to show a hyperlink is to an external site.</p>

<p>The problem is I find these additional &ldquo;indicators&rsquo; intrusive to reading the page. The underline commonly associated to hyperlinks on web pages is the least intrusive to my reading content.</p>

<p>If it were me, I would  keep the appearance of the linsk the same in the HTML, but I would open external links to a new browser tab or page while keeping internal links on the page one is in, if it is even important to the reader to understand the difference between an internal and external link.</p>

<p>Rather than a Platonic, matter and spirit (body and soul) metaphysics, Caputo says the distinction is between two types of time. Conditional time, or time spent doing this to achieve/obtain that, and unconditional time, times when something comes over us that is savored for itself. As metaphor, Caputo uses the rose, which is without why, it blossoms because it blossoms, it cares not for itself and not if it&rsquo;s seen.</p>

         	<p>What made local area and wireless networks happen are industry standards that enable different vendor products to work with each other. The Internet Of Things is nearly the exact opposite, in my home is a case in point. I have Hue lights that require a Hue hub for management and I have a number of sensors and smart switches that use Zigbee that I manage with Samsung&rsquo;s SmartThings hub.</p>

<p>The SmartThings hub can control the Hue lights, but the Hue hub only knows Hue products. I started first with the Hue lights and the hub, but if I had could have seen in the future I might have just bought the SmartThings hub. On the other hand, one big thing I get with the Hue hub is the use of a catalog of scenes that combine different colors to make for some pretty nice lighting in our basement.</p>

<p>I recently bought two cheaper Sylvania color smartlights when recent heavy rains suggested it might be nice to have a color smartlight in our living room, right now we have a non-color Hue light in the living room. We have a moisture sensor in the sump pump pit that works with the SmartThings hub and an automation in SmartThings that turns on all of the lights when moisture is detected. The automation sets the color lights to purple (homage to Prince) but obviously cannot do that with non-color lights. It happened the automation was recently triggered during the evening when the living room light might normally come on so I realize it just turning on might not be enough notification. Thus the idea to buy a color light, thus the purpose of the Sylvania light because the Hue light costs $50.</p>

<p>Before putting the new Sylvania light in the living room I decided to test it in the basement, where I have the color Hue lights, and here exposes the problem. The Hue lights are controlled by the Hue hub that knows nothing about the Sylvania light, this the Sylvania light cannot be part of the any of the Hue scenes. Perhaps I can find a &ldquo;third party&rdquo; app that works with SmartThings to replace Hue scenes, but I have not yet done the research.</p>

<p>Better, yet, would be an industry standard for controlling these color lights that would enable me to fully control them, with scenes, from one hub or &ldquo;smart device.&rdquo; Of course, this is a known problem and industy leaders appear to be working together to address it by developing <a href="https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/">a protocol called Matter</a>. Hopefully, there will be a day when all I need is one controlling device, technically right now I have three: Hue hub, SmartThings hub, Amazon Echo, and Google Home.</p>

<p>P.S. I really hope the Matter protocol addresses how smartlights handle resumption of power after a power outage. Hue added the ability to enforce the last known state, if a light was off when the power went off then it is supposed to stay off when power is restored. However, I&rsquo;ve found that doesn&rsquo;t work well with multiple successive short power loses. Worse, is the fact that the Sylvania light appears to not have such a setting. When power is restored the light turns on, regardless of its prior state.</p>

         	<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much to figure out why the Chicago Cubs have faded and are out of the running for the playoffs. <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats/team">Team batting average</a> is nearly dead last, ranked 28 of 30 teams. On base percentage is ranked 23, and slug is ranked 19. I am surprised that Cubs pitching is as good as it is, their team ERA of 4.10 puts them in the top 10, although their WHIP of 1.32 ranks them 18th in the league. (WHIP might be a better indicator than ERA.)</p>

<p>Bottom line is that the Chicago Cubs lineup is not very good. If you are another team looking to pick up a bat to help you make the playoffs, given the stats, beyond Kris Bryant, which other batters would you trade for to help your lineup?</p>

<p>Right now I cannot SSH in to the server but I do know that it is running and <a href="http://mywebstream.net/">serving up</a> an old Bitnomi default page. I decided to build a new server to replace it, but won&rsquo;t be able to move any of the data on the old server if I cannot get in to it.</p>

<p>I had nodestorage configured to publish the content to a S3 bucket, which is serving it directly, so I was not expecting the outage to affect the published site, but it does. When you first access the top navigation bar is delayed in loading. Looking at the page source I see variables that contain URLS back to that old site, one which appears to be defining a chat log socket. Unfortunately, this means to not have this affect on the old blog content I need to keep nodestorage running at the URL provided.</p>

One of my main complaints about Wear OS is that it requires me to install/manage apps directly on the watch, which is too difficult given the small screen. In the beginning Google enabled one to install/manage their watches from the phone and they took that away in favor of a standalone app store on the watch, a move that made no sense to me at the time even if that is something done on the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>So far I have not seen this update appear on my Pixel 4a. While I can see the Wear OS category in the Play Store, it still really is a list of Android smartphone apps that have Wear OS components, meaning if you have to first install the app on the phone and then go in to the Play Store on the watch to install the associated Wear OS app, which is a totally braindead approach!</p>

         	<p>Power came back on yesterday at 10:30 AM, which enabled us to get through most of the work day. We just started purging the fridge, so getting completely back to normal is going to take us a few days. People around me have it much worse, with trees falling on homes and cars, so I am grateful to just replace food.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There is a dynamism inside liberalism that they miss,” he told me. “The huge advantage of liberal democracy over other political systems is that its leadership constantly adjusts and changes, shifting to absorb new people and ideas. Liberal democracies don’t try, as Soviet Marxism once did, to make everybody agree about everything, all the time”</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2021/06/18.html#a183936">Dave</a>, in the context of the Internet, the garden and the stream are metaphors for two different approaches to content on the Internet. A stream is ephemeral, it continues to move over time and one mostly adds to it and watches it flow away. On the Internet a stream is content for only right now, and usually isn&rsquo;t edited nor looked at years later. Streams are date and time driven. Stream platforms are optimized for quick and easy entry of new content.</p>

<p>Twitter, Facebook, and blogs are examples of platforms used for publishing streams of content. Note that this is not absolute, for example one can and might edit a blog post they wrote a year ago in which case that blog might well be a garden.</p>

<p>The garden metaphor, in contrast, is more permanent. The content in a garden is continually edited to reflect new ideas or new learning over a period of time. A garden is organized around a topic. Platforms for creating and maintaining gardens are optimized for editing and linking together of content. Connecting the dots (linking) between content can generate new ideas or thoughts. Wiki is an example of a garden platform, as is the web itself as originally intended, as are other tools optimized for linking together and organizing content.</p>

<p>A couple of other interesting differences exist between the two from a user and platform provider perspective. Almost all streams are public, their very point is public sharing, and the platform providers freely provide their platforms and make their money my manipulating the presentation of what one puts in to the stream to others. Users have little to no control over who sees what they put in to the stream.</p>

<p>Gardens are either public or private, thus users tend to have more control over who and how one sees their content. Platform providers either freely provide their platform as open source for users to install in their own computers or they make money by hosting their platforms and charging uses for renting space on their hosting. The key point being the garden platform providers do not make money on the content. In my opinion, a site that has the purpose of making money from content is something other than a garden, so for example, I do not think of Medium as a garden, nor are other sites like The Verge or Engadget that may publish using a blogging or content management system.</p>

         	<p>This site is now back to full functionality, meaning the Photos and Archive pages full render. As part of the troubleshooting I changed the appearance of the site. When I look at the site using a desktop PC browser I am not pleased by the amount of white space on the left and right sides, nor do I like the navigation options a the top being right-justified. On the other hand, the site looks really nice on a smaller screen, and chances are if anyone does read this site they read it using a phone or tablet. So I think I will keep the appearance for now rather than revert to the prior layout. However, I reserve the right to try some of the other themes that are available to me.</p>

<p>Summer not only means warm weather, it also means a new version of Android is evolving toward a fall release. As Leo Laporte has said, we reached peak smartphone several years ago, therefore each release seems to be just new makeup. New makeup sells, but does nothing to actuality change that which it covers.</p>

<p>Rumors are that the next major Google Pixel phone will use Google&rsquo;s design of an ARM chip, so they can &ldquo;me-too&rdquo; with Apple and Microsoft. Will the new version of Android do anything that makes Google&rsquo;s chip design stand out?</p>

<p>The C.D.C. guidelines are essentially implying that the risk that the vaccinated will transmit the virus to others, including their unvaccinated children, is so vanishingly low that it is not worth worrying about.

<p>I trust Zeynep&rsquo;s judgement on these matters because she seems to apply informed common sense. My gut says indoor mask mandates should be in place until mid June.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/05/15/seeking-usbc-dock.html">Seeking USB-C Dock For 4K Monitor</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/05/15/seeking-usbc-dock.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-05-15 11:15:00 -0400">May 15, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> USB-C Docks that include USB 3 data ports most likely do not support DisplayPort 4K at 60 Hz unless they support DisplayPort 1.4. A dock with a DisplayPort port and USB 2.1 probably can do 4K@60Hz.</p>

<p>I recently bought a <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html">BenQ 4K monitor</a> and when I connected it to the USB-C dock that I had I found out that the dock could only support 4K at 30HZ, which is noticeably slow just when moving the mouse on the screen. Just about all the computer monitors we use support 60 Hz refresh rates.</p>

<p>Now, I was using my Pixelbook with the dock and I found that when I connect it to the monitor using a USB-C cable it can do 4K@60Hz, so I figured the dock was the limiting factor, which I confirmed on the manufacture&rsquo;s web site. I then started to search for docks that say they can do 4K@60Hz and decided on the <a href="https://us.anker.com/products/a8392">Anker PowerExpander</a>.</p>

<p>As you probably imagine by now, I got the new dock yesterday and found it also is only doing 4K@30Hz, on the HDMI and DisplayPorts. Sigh. I tested the dock with another computer and it does 4K@60Hz, so I am back looking at the Pixelbook.</p>

<p>I have since learned from <a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/2019/05/19/explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub/">this article</a> that the problem is that USB-C docks need to support data transfer as well as display and that decreases the number of lanes that are available for display at high refresh rates to two, whereas 4K@60Hz needs all four lanes. When you connect the Pixelbook to a monitor with a USB-C cable it can use all four of the cable&rsquo;s communication lanes to enable it to handle 4K@60Hz.</p>

<p>Anker&rsquo;s site says 4K on DisplayPort requires DisplayPort 1.4 and I have found that the Pixelbook only supports DisplayPort 1.2. As the article I found explains, DisplayPort 1.4 only needs two lanes for 4K@60Hz because it has an additional high bit rate mode and compression, which is why the Anker hub I have can do 4K@60Hz while also providing USB 3.1 data transfers. The problem is that the computer, hub, and monitor all need to support DisplayPort 1.4 for this all to work, and the Pixelbook does not.</p>

<p>The lesson from this experience is that connecting to high resolution monitors at high refresh rates via a hub is more complicated than simply using a cable because it requires understanding the technical capabilities of the computer, hub, and monitor. You may have to dig to find out whether a computer, and a Chromebook in particular, supports DisplayPort 1.4. Thunderbolt 3 also supports 4K@60Hz and fast data transfers but is not yet available in Chromebooks and Thunderbolt 3 docks are more expensive than USB-C docks.</p>

<p>I think my experience that I&rsquo;ve written about here explains why <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/chromebook-docking-stations/">Google recently announced</a> the addition of docks to their &ldquo;Works With Chromebook&rdquo; program. If Google were to announced a new Pixelbook this summer that had DisplayPort 1.4 support (or Thunderbolt 3) it would be helpful to know exactly which Docks can do 4K@60Hz.</p>

<p>As for my current situation, even though this new Anker dock cannot provide 4K@60Hz with my Pixelbook, it has more display ports to drive multiple monitors and has more data ports than the hub it replaced, so I still have an upgrade over the dock I was using previously. However, had I known what I now know prior to purchasing this Anker dock, I probably would have bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B06Y5N3YCD/?tag=runworks-20">this Cable Matters dock</a> instead as I could live with USB 2.1. For now I using the slightly lower 2560 x 1600 resolution at 60Hz rather than 4K, but if I really want 4K I can connect directly to the monitor via one USB-C port and use the dock on the other for power and the additional ports.</p>

<p>In Michigan, if you are fully vaccinated, you are not required to wear a mask. How does a restaurant or store know whether or not a person is fully vaccinated? Most likely people will just stop wearing masks and those who opt to wear them will become stigmatized.</p>

<p>And we are not yet at 50% of people fully vaccinated. We may be ok for the summer, but when the cold weather hits and people start congregating in poorly ventilated indoor locations, there will be outbreaks, and then, what will happen?</p>

<p>Keep in mind, mask wearing is never really been about personal protection against infection, it&rsquo;s been about preventing spread by people who do not yet know they are infected from spreading it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/05/12/i-am-following.html">A Wiki User&#39;s Expectation Of Double Square Brackets</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/05/12/i-am-following.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-05-12 12:00:00 -0400">May 12, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am following <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/05/12.html#a142449">Dave&rsquo;s writing</a> about the integration of <a href="http://littleoutliner.com">Little Outliner</a> with apps like Obsidian and Logseq. I think it&rsquo;s important to note that neither Obsidian nor Logseq are outliners, they are markdown editors with outlining and wiki features. I would characterize Little Oultiner as an outline editor that could have other features like wiki and markdown.</p>

<p>How Obsidian handles text between doulbe brackets is an example of a feature it incorporates from wikis. There is an existing standard for using double brackets, it is an <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links">internal wiki link</a> and the expected action is that it automatically links to a page that exists within the app hosting and editing the content. Usually what is between the double square brackets is the name of the page. If the page already exists, clicking the link loads that page in the app. If the page does not already exist, clicking the link creates a new page with that title in which one can then edit.</p>

<p>The key is that an internal link is generated and managed by the editing app not the user, where as an external link is provided and managed by the user of the app. As an example, I edit <a href="http://frankm.info">my now page</a> in Little Outliner that I think is currently served by an instance of PagePark. (Click <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/?url=http://instantoutliner.com/i9">here</a> to see the outline in Little Outliner) On that page the fourth note has a link to <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">tech.frankm.info</a> that is another outline I edit in Little Outliner. I created the link between the two using the linking tool in Little Outliner, but what if I had put double brackets around the words Technology That I Use in that sentence?</p>

<p>Based on my experience with <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">wiki</a>, Obsidian, and Roam, I expect that when a double bracket is put around those words Little Outliner creates a link to an outline (a page if you will in Little Outliner) with the name &ldquo;Technology That I Use.&rdquo; If I click that link in Little Outliner it opens the page in Little Outliner (could be a tab) and displays the contents of the page, or a blank page if it is new.</p>

<p>To complete the thought, from a publishing perspective, PagePark could follow the internal link to the OPML file and render it as it does today, with the net result of more easily writing and publishing a multi-page site edited by Little Outliner and served by PagePark.</p>

<p>Long time users of Little Outliner may recall <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/05/15/watchthis.html#4">the glossary function</a> that automatically substitutes text between double quotes to corresponding text in a separate file. One way you can think of it is like a text expander where you can put a commonly used abbreviation in quotes and when the outline is rendered the associated text in the glossary file is subsituted.</p>

<p>For example, if you look at the second bullet under Notes in <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/?url=http://instantoutliner.com/i9">my status outline</a> you see that &ldquo;my blog&rdquo; and &ldquo;my Twitter feed&rdquo; are in quotes and on <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml#1586545154000">the published page</a> you see them as hyperlinks because I have the HTML for the hyperlinks in my glossary file, which is specified by the urGlossary value in the OPML head of the file. When I was publishing <a href="http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/">my blog using Fargo.io</a>, (and prior iterations of Dave&rsquo;s blogging platforms) the glossary was one of my favorite time saving features.</p>

         	<p>I have a few Personal Automations on my iPad that should trigger when I open and close an app. Up until a recent update to iPadOS, or to Shortcuts, both triggers worked but now the close app trigger does not work. I read that when first released Personal Automations only triggered upon open but there was no option for closed and it looks like some code was reverted in a recent release.</p>

         	<p>For me the most frustrating and disappointing thing about reactions to COVID is that so many people only think about it in terms of personal health and not public health. I may be at lower risk of severe symptoms but I can carry the disease to someone who is at high risk. The possibility that I could do something that results in the death of another obligates me to take the situation seriously.</p>

<p>Another problem that people don&rsquo;t seem to grasp is that longer the virus out of control the more mutations that will occur, which has consequences to all of us. It is likely the recent surge in Michigan is due to a mutation.</p>

I am not experienced with home repairs and in the past managed to mangle toilet repair enough to call in a professional to fix the job. So, in normal circumstances I would have just scheduled a plumber to repair, but I decided to search for information, found videos on YouTube that showed me what to do, and today I bought the parts and made the replacement as easily as was shown in the video.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve swapped the two devices between ports and that fixes the mouse issue, but then the headset loses connectivity, so I think that means there is some type of interference with the right USB port.</p>

<p>I think another reason why Republicans are not willing to change is that they have not yet faced reality that they are a minority. Their arguments for why the 2020 presidential election was &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; can only hold if they think there is more of them than others. In other words, if Republicans are a minority then by definition they will get less votes, and we have seen this played out by the fact that since 1988 they have lost the popular vote for all but one presidential election.</p>

It seems obvious to me that the Cubs&rsquo; front office does not properly evaluate hitting talent, every player on their team is a home run hitter. When Schwarber left they went and got a literal hitting duplicate, Joc Pederson, as a replacement. Nico Horner was the best hitter in spring training and they sent him back to the minors in favor of another home run hitter.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t blame the manager, and I can&rsquo;t really blame the players, they are who they area. The problem rests entirely with the front office. Really, one hit wonders. How lucky we were in 2016!</p>

When I ordered the monitor, which is <a href="https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html">a BenQ 32-inch</a>, I was concerned by the fact that the height was not adjustable and it would be too low, but that has proven to not be an issue. If anything the monitor might be a tad too high.</p>

<p>According to the ergonomic recommendations, the top of the monitor should be at eye level. In my case the top bevel of the monitor is a couple of inches above my eye level. I could raise my chair to move my eye level up, but then my feet don&rsquo;t comfortably touch the floor and I felt it in my legs.</p>

<p>On the other hand with the larger screen I am now viewing content in separate windows rather than full screen. Consequently I can move the windows in which content is displayed to where it is most comfortable, and so there is a gap in the display at the top that I will never really look at.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve installed the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/">Windows 10 PowerToys</a> so that I can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones">FancyZones</a> windows manager to create layouts for placing windows on the screen. My current configuration has one large window occupying about 65% of the left side where I display the primary 1580 x 1356 window I am viewing. The remaining screen space on the right is split in half, with a top 792 x 661 and bottom 792 x 653 windows for MS Teams and Outlook.  The smaller windows are for glancing at information, either chats, calendar, or my inbox. When I process my inbox in Outlook I move Outlook to the larger window on the left of the screen.</p>

<p>To complete the picture, I also us two virtual desktops, the primary one I described above, the secondary one I have OneNote in the large window, Microsoft Todo, and File Manager in the two smaller windows.</p>

People need to understand that the faster the rate of infection the higher the percentage of full vaccination needed to affect the spread.  In short, thinking that because people can now get vaccines one can revert to pre-COVID behavior is increasing how much longer we are dealing with this and the continued risks of more mutations.</p>

It&rsquo;s not just about whether or not I might die if I got the disease, it&rsquo;s how much it might ruin my health, forever, if I got the disease.</p>

<p>I think far too many people are just looking at the death rates and thinking COVID is no worse than the flu or pneumonia, which have their risks but low probability of resulting in death without pre-existing conditions.</p>

<p>The problem with those comparisons is that we know much more about those illnesses than we know about COVID. The unknown consequences increase risk to everyone because we know of people who are otherwise in good health becoming seriously ill and even dying.</p>

         	<p>I read <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-the-west-lost-covid-19.html">this long piece</a> about how western countries have struggled to respond to COVID, which resulted in a tremendous loss of life. To me, it boils down to one issue, politics. It seems that in western countries led by elected leaders, decisions and lack of decisions were due to the calculus of political consequences. For example, the Trump administration&rsquo;s slow response was due to all decisions made in terms of whether they help or hinder their ability to be re-elected. In the east there were no worries about election consequences, so there was probably little debate over whether to move fast or be alarmist.</p>

<p>In the United States we seemed to have lost the idea that there should be non-partisans in government positions so they focus entirely on the public interest and not on their political ambitions. The transition is most obvious in what has happened to the Supreme Court, which unlike the intent of the Founders, has in practice become partisan.</p>

         	<p>Weeks ago Michigan began &ldquo;opening&rdquo; up again by allowing more people in restaurants and bars and more sporting events. Predictably, the number of new COVID-19 cases has been trending back up. I wish people would <a href="https://emhsd.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ea9fb6d9caaa4937995113dbd5d0a87a">look at the graphs</a>, it shows the numbers keep going up when we open up and down when we close down.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I strongly suspect the governor is less likely to impose another lock down due to the amount of pressure put on by the people who continually cause the increase in numbers.</p>

         	<p>I set up a new <a href="https://tv.google/">Google TV</a> to replace the Chromecast that was connected to our living room TV. The change was driven by the increase in the number of streaming services/apps that we now use, and which previously was primarily accessed via the Apple TV attached to the TV in our basement. Google TV <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/chromecast-with-google-tv">doesn&rsquo;t look much different</a> than Apple TV, and I imagine Roku isn&rsquo;t much different either. The remote enables voice access to Google Assistant, which I use more than Siri. I did notice that the MLB At Bat app is not the same as the one on Apple TV, but Netflix, Disney+, ParamontPlus, and Amazon all look much the same. Google TV costs much less than Apple TV. Ironically, I set up the Apple TV app and it too looks pretty much the same. I have to chuckle about running Apple TV on a Google product.</p>

If they don&rsquo;t, they won&rsquo;t have a compelling reason for people to buy watches then. The fact that Google bought Fitbit doesn&rsquo;t help the matter.

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve been wondering about <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/26/new-moto-wear-os/">the future of Wear OS</a> in light of Google closing the acquisition of Fitbit and that there are so few watches with the new <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-platform">Qualcomm 4100</a> processor. I suspect Google has drastically slowed development on Wear OS and that has forced companies to hold back launching watches with the 4100 because it may be the only new thing about them in the next year. If I am right that may mean we won&rsquo;t see many watches with the latest processor until the fall.</p>

<p>Personally, the Fossil Sport that I currently wear has all the &ldquo;features&rdquo; I need but performance is not exactly reliable. I&rsquo;ve begun to think one of the latest Fitbits might be good. I really wish Apple would do with Apple Watch what they did with the iPod and make it work with Android, which I think would decisively the end Wear OS, but Apple appears committed to the halo Watch gives to iPhone.</p>

         	<p>In this essay,<a href="https://om.co/2021/02/25/the-death-of-a-retailer/">The Death of a Retailer</a>, Om Malik writes fondly about Fry&rsquo;s and its inevitable passing. I agree strongly with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In retrospect, as is often the case, Fry’s death was inevitable. In Fry’s heyday, many of us built our own computers (or at least tinkered with them). We bought software and installed it. The struggle of being a lover of computers was what made it so special. Every year, however, computers became less cumbersome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Come to think about it, &ldquo;the struggle&rdquo; is what captured my imagination about computers and why I still tinker.</p>

<p>James Madison and his colleagues believed that by deviating from theoretical majority-rules principles, the American republic would benefit from more stability, a better protection of rights, and generally a higher quality of person in positions of authority. But ironically, it is precisely where minority rule bites deepest that this promise is revealed to be most false. &ndash; David Frum, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/america-must-become-democracy/618028/">Democracy Is the Only Solution</a></p>

<p>Madison could not have imagined how the Constitution they wrote creates the structure that allows the combination of technology and wealth to create autocratic minority rule. People who believe the U.S. Constitution is without flaw need to address for whom does it really provide liberty?</p>

         	<p>The article, <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2021/01/30/why-generation-x-will-save-the-web/">Why Generation X will save the web</a>, makes an important point for those concerned about new laws written regarding the Internet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government and policy – the mechanics and grunt work, not the media showmanship – are powered by an army of hard-working, very young people who have all of the academic knowledge and very little of the practical experience. Those young folks, now, in 2021, who were in nappies when I was on the Hill, now run whatever corridors of power they (virtually) travel through, in professional support of those older politicians.</p>

<p>And it’s these young professionals – not the boomer career politicians – who are setting the tone of internet policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the article suggests, we tend to think it&rsquo;s gray haired Senators, who don&rsquo;t understand the Internet, who are going to write new laws against encryption and other parts of what we call the open Internet, and that is wrong. The laws will be written by millenials who have never known the open Internet. The only Internet millenials know is the bad, closed corporate Internet of Facebook and Twitter and Medium.</p>

<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they don&rsquo;t protect that which they have never known nor experienced.</p>

         	<p>Given the number of <a href="https://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pis</a> I have, you might get the impression that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker</a>, but I am not. I&rsquo;ve just been enamored by these small, inexpensive single board computers. The closest I&rsquo;ve come so far to a real project is what I call my desk clock, which is a Pi installed behind a five inch monitor that displays Chromium kiosk mode with a screen I configure using <a href="https://dakboard.com">Dakboard</a>.</p>

<p>I originally built the desk clock using a Raspberry Pi 2 that stopped working a few weeks ago. This past weekend tried to troubleshoot the problem. First I built a new SD card and it seemed to boot fine, but after a few more tests I found that the USB WiFi dongle was not reliably connecting to the home network, so I decided to re-purpose a Pi 3 that was on my desk for the desk clock.</p>

<p>To retain the backup and archive functions that Pi 3 was performing, I moved it&rsquo;s SD card to a Pi 3b+ and then built a new SD card for the desk clock, except this time I cheated by using a pre-built image that dakboard provides.</p>

<p>The net result is that I now have one less Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk. Last night as I was putting things away I found another Pi 3 I already had been storing, which if I had known about would have simplified things, but not resulted in one less Pi on my desk.</p>

<p>For a summary of my Raspberry Pis, expand the <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/techThatIUse.opml#1594992722000">Every Day Tech</a> branch of <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">my Technology outline</a>.</p>

<p>Religious evangelicals may look at these numbers and think, “This is not what the term evangelical means.” The assumption is that the term describes those who place high value on the teachings of the Bible and strive to evangelize other people into their faith. However, that understanding of the term seems to be fading, replaced with a more amorphous concept that melds together religious doctrine and an affinity for conservative politics that experts are only beginning to understand now.</p>

<p>The above is a bug, not a feature. One can argue that the assimilation of Christianity into the Roman Empire in 313 huge negative consequences on Christianity, and it probably was not good for empire either.</p>

         	<p>What&rsquo;s ironic is that every person arrested for the insurrection on the U.S. Capital on January 6, 2021 will expect, and demand, that everyone provide, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence">the presumption of innocence</a>, which requires the accuser to prove by providing evidence in court that the accused commited a crime. Yet, these people wanted state legislatures, the Supreme Court, or Congress to nullify the election results based on their accusuation of voter fraud.</p>

<p>The point being, the people storming the Capital really weren&rsquo;t defending the Constitution nor do they really want to live in the world they think they are fighting for. Presumption of innocence means they have the possibility of not being put in jail by a force greater than themselves and that same presumption of innocence might be the only thing that saved the Republic, this time.</p>

         	<p>The conclusion I reach after reading the New Yorker story, &ldquo;<a href="https://app.getpocket.com/read/3230122334">Among the Insurrectionists</a>&rdquo; is that at the least we live in two Americas, if not in two realities. I also don&rsquo;t see a way for any real resolution because the people described in the article cannot be reasoned with, they only want their way. Democrats can’t fix this, and while Republicans have the only chance, even those who do not &ldquo;comply&rdquo; will not be listened too.</p>

<p>For me, it comes down to principles. Republicans had principles at one time, such as demonstrated by John McCain when he pushed back when someone wanted to brand Obama a Muslim, implying all Muslims are enemies.</p>

<p>The fact that so many Republican members of Congress abetted the insurrection is proof to me that the lust for power and having their own way is far stronger than the principles of democracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt established business regulation, a basic social safety net, and government-funded infrastructure in the 1930s to combat the Great Depression that had laid ordinary Americans low, one right-wing senator wrote to a colleague: “This is despotism, this is tyranny, this is the annihilation of liberty…. The ordinary American is thus reduced to the status of a robot. The president has not merely signed the death warrant of capitalism, but has ordained the mutilation of the Constitution, unless the friends of liberty, regardless of party, band themselves together to regain their lost freedom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems to me a problem is that we don&rsquo;t have common agreement on the core principles on the founding of the United States as stated in <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992">the preamble to U.S. Constitution</a>, particularly, &ldquo;promote the general Welfare.&rdquo;</p>

I think it gets at a lot of things that people who are unhappy are dealing with. Here is one of the important points:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Outside of agriculture, more than one in three working Americans belonged to a union in the fifties. In 1983, one in five belonged to a union; by 2019, only one in ten did. Union membership declined; income inequality rose. To explain this, Suzman points to the “Great Decoupling” of the nineteen-eighties: <strong>wages and economic growth used to track each other.</strong> From about 1980, in the United States, the G.D.P. kept growing, even as real wages stagnated.

<p>It’s absolutely plausible to me that even more Republicans would have joined this blatant attempt to overturn the election and that their base would mostly have been fine with that. The (self)-coup train wasn’t something that was just for show; it just wasn’t close enough to work this time.</p>

My grandfather grew up in Milwaukee and so a fan of the Milwaukee Brewers but the Yankees were the villain and the Dodgers the hero for us during these games. Of course Lasorda was the manager of the Dodgers during those games, so news of his passing brought back these memories today.</p>

We found the line was literaly no less than an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States. And these are people who call themselves patriots? If they really want to do the right thing they should resign.</p>

<p>The thing is, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter now. What&rsquo;s going to matter is when in four years and the Republican Presidential primaries start does the party push back against Trump and any who follow his playbook, or do they do all the same things again? It already started when Congress finally reviewed and accpeted the Electoral College results.</p>

<p>At this point I think the lust for supremacy is what Republicans are all about. They could not take a principaled stand until literally forced to by an attempted coup. I for one right now cannot imagine how I can ever trust anyone who is Republican and desires the power of federal office. We cannot let Republicans re-frame the story in a way that does not make them culpable in what happened on January 6, 2021, for they built the platform upon which Trump and his followers spoke and acted, starting with birtherism.</p>

         	<p>What frightens me the most is people not taking the threat Trump poses seriously enough. POTUS is considered one of the most powerful positions in the world for a reason. He removed many of the civilian positions in the defense department for a reason. We got to stop thinking it&rsquo;s not possible and instead identify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology">the worst thing Trump could do</a> between now and January 20, 2021 and prepare counter measures.</p>

         	<p>What ought to be clear to Congress, the DOJ, to the Armed Forces, and anyone in power that is not associated with Trump is that IF Trump is NOT removed from office now then at a minimum they must prepare to act swiftly to respond to the actions of this rogue President. Anything less is at best negligence. Trump is a hostile and the threat he poses needs to be taken seriously. No more &ldquo;what harm can he do&rdquo; <a href="https://nitter.net/zeynep/status/1347246007126536193#m">attitude</a> from anyone in power.

         	<p>As a long time blogger I wonder some time about how blogging has contributed to the current state of politics in the United States. Blogging made it easy to publish to the web and thus made it easy for nearly everyone to publish their opinions. The problem it seems to me is that we have begun to value opinions more than facts or even truth. Trump and his supporters are so firm in their opinion that the election was stolen from him that they think their opinion is fact, and that because something could happen, it did happen, which is the definition of a conspiracy theory.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am using <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/raspberry-pi-4">a Raspberry Pi 4</a> (daenerys) as <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/using-the-raspberry-pi4-as-a-remote-desktop">my desktop personal computer during the work day</a>, which I access from my work provided computer <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/01/04/the-official-images.html">using VNC</a>. By using this Pi 4 I can access the Internet from my desk without going through the corporate Internet proxy.</p>

<p>I built daenerys in <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">a Flirc case</a>, which looks really nice and provides passive cooling, and it boots from a SSD in an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inateck-Inch-Drive-Enclosure-External/dp/B00FCLG65U/ref=pd_lpo_147_t_0/144-8444920-6603364?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00FCLG65U&amp;pd_rd_r=e1377215-a1a4-4ae0-ba6c-f447c6cb3705&amp;pd_rd_w=AoENj&amp;pd_rd_wg=Awfxl&amp;pf_rd_p=16b28406-aa34-451d-8a2e-b3930ada000c&amp;pf_rd_r=P77HN0BMNZCMMG2TEZX4&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=P77HN0BMNZCMMG2TEZX4">Inateck case</a>. The SSD gets power from the Pi and so under normal load I would see temperatures hover around 55 degrees celcius, which is well below the 85 degree threshold that causes the CPU to throttle down.</p>

<p>Over the holiday <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/myTechProjects.opml#1608128858000">I built another Raspberry Pi 4</a> (arya) in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MazerPi-Raspberry-Cooling-Heatsink-Model/dp/B07W3ZMVP1">a MazerPi case</a> that has a fan. The fan draws power from the GPIO pins and has two modes, high speed if plugged in to the 5v pin (PIN 2) and low speed if plugged in to the 3.3v pin (PIN1). To complete the picture, ground is plugged in th PIN 6.</p>

<p>The MazerPi fan just stays on all the time, I am not aware of a way to control the fan so that it only comes on when a certain temperature threshold is past. I first plugged the fan in to one of the 5v pins and found it loud enough to be heard, although not terribly loud. When using high speed mode the CPU temperatures were in the mid to high 30 degree range under normal load. When I ran Octane 2 it then crossed 40 degrees.</p>

<p>I decided to try the low speed mode, which is quiet enough to not hear unless one concentrates. Temperatures where in the 40 to 45 degree range, which is plenty good.</p>

<p>At this point the thought occurred to me that it probably makes sense to use the case with the fan for the Pi that I am going to use every day rather than in one I am going to use as an accessory and thus I removed the SD card from arya and plugged in the SSD from daenerys and it booted right up. (BTW, note that in reality a computer host name is associated with the boot drive and not the actual computer, so daenerys is really the 250 GB SSD drive while arya is a 256 GB SD card.)</p>

<p>Finally, I decided I wanted to try overclocking daenerys, which given the fan should be safe. Normal speed for this Pi4 board is 1.5 GHz, so I decided to overclock it to 2 GHz. Performance is noticably faster. At 1.5 Ghz daenery&rsquo;s Octane 2 score is 8098 and at 2.0 Ghz the score is 9777. Neither score is fantastic, but good enough for the type of web browsing that I do.</p>

<p>When you overclock a CPU it will run hotter and that can cause failures. In the MazerPi, with the fan in low speed mode, and the Pi 4 booting from a SSD and overclocked to a max frequency of 2 GHz and a minimum frequency of 1 GHz I am seeing temperatures ranging from 46 degrees to 55 degress, which is about the same as well using the Pi in the Flirc case but not overclocked.</p>

<p>The net result is that have &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; daenerys to a faster processing speed that provides better performance while maintaining a good CPU temperature and so far after one full working day it has been stable. The MazerPi case cost only $8 and is easy to assemble with help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_stCwXmRiA">a video</a> I found on YouTube.</p>

When the 64-bit version was first released RealVNC Server was not available so I have been using <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/installing-x11vnc-server">x11vnc</a> to remote connect to the Pi. Today I learned that RealVNC Server is now available for the beta but has to be enabled via the terminal using raspi-config, so I switched. I don&rsquo;t know whether anyone else will find this useful, but it feels like RealVNC is faster than x11vnc.</p>

         	<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/_1jAuCly20Y/index.html">CNN is airing a documentary</a> about the first modern outsider elected President before Trump, Jimmy Carter. When I think back about Carter&rsquo;s years as President I think what happened is that he showed us reality that we did not like very much. It&rsquo;s no wonder then that he lost to a professional actor and that in many ways we have been living in a delusion that has been amplified by Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would the rock-and-roll set flock to a man who, as president, is remembered today as being a micro-managing, straight-arrow engineer who failed to inspire or understand leadership? The reason is that in his prime, Jimmy Carter was cool. He championed a kind of political populism that was extremely attractive to Americans disillusioned with Washington in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. Sick and tired of elected officials who betrayed them, they found a refreshing change in Carter, a former peanut farmer who was seen as an anti-establishment outsider. As Bishop Michael Curry recalls in the documentary, &ldquo;We were coming out of the Watergate era and looking &hellip;to be a country of integrity again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with the quote above from Bishop Curry is that I am not sure the United States has ever been a &ldquo;country of integrity.&rdquo; I think some of the founders had this aspiration but failed to see the log in their eye of supremacy is the forms of slavery and colonialism.</p>

<p>To me the greatest irony of the Trump presidency has been that part of the campaign slogan, &ldquo;Make America Great&rdquo; is a good and right aspiration but demands a degree of introspection on what is greatness and who determines greatness.</p>

<p>P.S. I observe that it seems all one term presidents of my life time became one term because that were a mirror reflecting ourselves that we did not like very much. Our egos much prefer the myths of our false selves than the reality of our true selves.</p>

         	<p>“The symbol of Christmas—what is it? It is the rainbow arched over the roof of the sky when the clouds are heavy with foreboding. It is the cry of life in the newborn babe when, forced from its mother’s nest, it claims its right to live. It is the brooding Presence of the Eternal Spirit making crooked paths straight, rough places smooth, tired hearts refreshed, dead hopes stir with newness of life. It is the promise of tomorrow at the close of every day, the movement of life in defiance of death, and the assurance that love is sturdier than hate, that right is more confident than wrong, that good is more permanent than evil.” — Howard Thurman <a href="https://email.cac.org/t/ViewEmail/d/71791578E21F49DA2540EF23F30FEDED/3F2D2805E5B983A925D77A725F39070E">source</a></p>

         	<p>Today is the second day of <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/12/21/trying-vivaldi.html">using Vivaldi on the Raspberry Pi 4 desktop</a>, and it continues to perform better for me than Chromium. I decided to run Octane 2 and Speedometer 2 to see how Vivaldi benchmarks against Chromium and I am surprised to find that it benchmarks slightly slower in both even though my practical use finds it faster. For example, Speedometer 2 scores 7.93 in Chromium and 7.614 in Vivaldi. For comparison, the Speedometer 2 score on the iPad Air is 201, fastest in the house.</p>

         	<p>One of the most dangerous ideas that emerged in politics starting in the 1970s is that changing one&rsquo;s mind about a policy or topic is wrong. We heard politicians claim that their opponent &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(politics)#Influence_on_public">flip-flops</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, too many people have taken this to mean that they must not change their minds about something, but changing one&rsquo;s mind over time is what growing up is all about. Is it any wonder then that people are now so entrenched in their ideas they simply do not listen nor accept anything spoken by someone else that they don&rsquo;t agree with?</p>

<p>The &ldquo;no flip-flop&rdquo; mindset can have dangerous consequences. If scientists aren&rsquo;t willing to consider the possibility that how they thought something happens, like <a href="https://nitter.net/zeynep/status/1341161935904059394#m">how respiratory illness spreads</a>, could be flawed, lives can be lost. Not to mention scientists who don&rsquo;t believe they could be wrong aren&rsquo;t really practicing science.</p>

<p>If you want to really impress me, tell me about something you changed your mind about in the last three years.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I use a Raspberry Pi 4 as a personal remote computer that I access using VNC during the work day, which enables me to keep my personal web access from going through my employer&rsquo;s Internet proxy. It&rsquo;s also an excuse of me to fiddle with the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>I have been using Chromium for browing the web but grown frustrated with its performance on the Pi so this morning I decided to give <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> a try. Vivaldi uses the same rendering engine as Chrome and I&rsquo;ve found it uses the same extensions as Chrome, which is important because I need access to Lastpass.</p>

<p>Installation was a little tricky because I am running <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1668160">a beta 64-bit version of the Raspberry Pi OS</a> and so I needed to find the <a href="https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/53927/linux-arm-32-64-bit-os-with-drm-enable-gpu-hardware-accelerated-how-to/2">arm64 version</a> of the installation package.</p>

<p>So far I am finding that Vivaldi does run faster on the Pi4 than Chromium. One thing I did to speed things up is to turn off the drop-down, URL completion of the address bar so that I can quickly enter URLs. However, one function that I use to forage for new updates in the Federated Wiki verse does not work, for some reason, so for now I will need to use Chromium for that part of my daily flow.</p>

         	<p>“Several years ago when I was in Nicaragua, I asked a man if he had time, and he said, “I have the rest of my life,” and smiled. Who of us would possibly say that? That is what we don’t have. What we don’t have is the rest of our lives because we do not even have the now of our lives.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time is exactly what we do not have. What decreases in a culture of affluence is precisely and strangely time—along with wisdom and friendship. These are the very things that the human heart was created for, that the human heart feeds on and lives for. No wonder we are producing so many depressed, unhealthy and even violent people, while also leaving a huge carbon footprint on this poor planet.&rdquo;</p>

         	<p>I do not take comfort in SCOTUS deciding to not take up Texas&rsquo; lawsuit against the four swing states. First, SCOTUS simply hid behind procedure and thus were not the adults in the room standing against tyranny. What is even more troubling to me is that I am sure President Trump fully expected &ldquo;his&rdquo; SCOTUS justices to keep him in office, I am sure in his mind that is what they owed him for seating them. The fact that any person considers any judges to be &ldquo;his,&rdquo; particularly Justices is frightening.</p>

<p>What we must learn from this episode of U.S. history is that it matters how anyone who would be President views the powers and responsibilities of the office. The U.S. Constitution is not intended to give anyone extreme powers, its intention is exactly the opposite. The fact that people think elections are all about power shows how much we have strayed from the founding principles of the United States.</p>

<p>If we don&rsquo;t learn from this year and make meaningful changes then all we have done is prevent the end of the U.S. for the time being and increased the likelihood that it will not see its tricentennial. It takes more to preserve freedom than waving a flag and standing for the national anthem.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/trump-constitution-norms.html">Tim Wu makes a good case</a> that the vaunted &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo; of the U.S. constitution has not really shown to be reality. The only thing that has prevented democracy in the U.S. from being overthrown has been the integrity of a frighteningly small number of people.</p>

<p>In my opinion we must not allow Republicans to paint a picture that this threat has only been because of Donald Trump. None of what we have endured is due to just Trump, in fact a case can be made that none of it is on Trump, instead it has all been on the Republican Party. Never forget, Trump won the Republican Party nomination for President, and if he had not then we would have not had four years of a Trump presidency and who knows how many fewer lives would have been saved from the pandemic.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t be patting ourselves on the back thinking democracy prevailed. All that we really have is possibly a victory of one battle, but Republicans have been waging war on the United States since the 1940s and will continue fighting that war in to the future. As long as there is no consequence on Republicans they will remain to be a clear and present danger.</p>

         	<p>I think main lesson we need to learn from COVID-19 is that a pandemic can and will happen again in the United States and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">we need to address it nationally like we address every other threat</a>.

         	<p>I took a look at my Xfinity (Comcast) account again today due to the pending enforcement of their data caps. What I see on Xfinity&rsquo;s site is that while I thought they had turned caps off, it might have been on since July. What bothers me is that it doesn&rsquo;t look like Xfinity provides any warning to users when they are about to exceed their data cap. I thought there was an account configuration so that I could have Xfinity send me an email when I&rsquo;ve consumed 50% and 75% of the data, but I don&rsquo;t see any option. In my opinion, any service that has data caps and corresponding charges when they are exceed should be legally required to provide customers warnings that they are going to exceed those caps.</p>

         	<p>I am still bumming since learning on Friday that <a href="https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2020/12/5/22155774/len-kasper-replacement-cubs-tv-booth">Len Kasper is leaving the Chicago Cubs</a> to be the lead radio announcer for the White Sox. What I like about Len is that he is a genuine baseball guy, he isn&rsquo;t a broadcaster who also does baseball, so moving from TV to radio makes sense. Of all sports baseball is best for radio.</p>

<p>My life experience with the Chicago Cubs has always been narrated by TV play-by-play guys: Jack Brickhouse, Harry Caray, Chip Caray, and Len Kasper. There have been a few others who have been briefly behind the mike, but these are the voices that replay in my head.</p>

<p>The first words are Jack&rsquo;s calling another Dave Kingman home run. Most of the words are spoken by Harry, who was with me from teenager to adult. Chip is sentimental following his grandfathers death, where Len will always be part of the Cubs finally making it to and winning the World Series in 2016.</p>

<p>White Sox fans are getting a great baseball guy to tell them the White Sox story when baseball starts in 2021. I might try to listen to a few games, particularly when the White Sox come to Detroit and Len sits closer to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Harwell">Ernie Harwell&rsquo;s</a> seat. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll watch for who will be next at broadcasting for the Cubs.</p>

<p>Even if allowed to, I will not eat in a restaurant until I am vaccinated and this pandemic is under control, for two main reasons. First, one cannot eat and wear a mask at the same time. Second, I have no idea of the air flow within the restaurants I might dine in, and air flow can cause the virus to be spread across greater distances than six feet.</p>

Over the years I&rsquo;ve tried using different keyboard cases with tablets and usually end up setting them aside because I found it too difficult to switch between hand-held and keyboard modes. The magnetic attachment of the iPad to the keyboard makes it easy to remove and re-attach the iPad to the case, so when I want to hold the tablet to read or write notes with the Apple Pencil, it&rsquo;s no more difficult than picking the iPad up off the table and when I want to type notes it&rsquo;s as easy as placing the iPad back on to the magnetic back of the case.</p>

<p>The main negative of the case is that it adds a lot of bulk and weight, so there are times when I won&rsquo;t want to carry both. When we get back to being able to travel around freely I will probably get Apple&rsquo;s Smart Folio, which also attaches magnetically, to protect the iPad Air in those instances.</p>

<p>When the nation state came to glory in the 19th century, it was as a bulwark against religion.
The great threat of our time is the unity of the state and religion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish citizens of the United States would think a bit more deeply about our history, particularly the context in which First Amendment was written. The world from 313 AD until when the U.S. Constiution was ratified was basically governed by a theocracy. You had the Holy Roman Empire and Rome ruling most of the western world, then came Protestantism and it&rsquo;s alignment with kings and <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/thirty-years-war">The Thirty Years War</a>, and then, more directly you have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/cofe/cofe_1.shtml#:~:text=Henry%20VIII%20started%20the%20process,borne%20him%20only%20a%20daughter.&amp;text=Henry%20adopted%20the%20title%20given,of%20Defender%20of%20the%20Faith.">the Church of England</a> that emerged to consolidate power in England when Henry VIII wanted an annulment that the Pope would not grant.</p>

<p>The founders knew how those who seek power, be they kings, dictators, oligarchs, and political parties, use religion to increase that power. After all, it&rsquo;s one thing for a President to say something, it&rsquo;s another when a preacher claims what he or she says is the literal word of god.</p>

<p>So, while <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">the first ammendment constrains</a> the U.S. government of what it can do to religions, <strong>more importantly it is intended to prevent the merger of religious and political power.</strong></p>

<p>I agree with Dana&rsquo;s warning about our real risk, which is the emergence of a religious-based rule in the United States. It started with Ronald Regan creating the snowball and rolling it down the hill to create the &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/Yz4AmUaLbUQ">Religious Right</a>&rdquo; under <a href="https://youtu.be/pPsderlzd6c">the pretext</a> of a Pro-Life movement. It picked up more steam to elect George W. Bush that lead to a tremendous amount of lost life in wars authorized by national emergencies that are still not over. And finally in a mutal in-sincere but profitable alliance, enabled and put in place Donald Trump, and with him the breaking of everything Jesus taught.</p>

<p>Please, if you call yourself Christian and find yourself agreeing completely with these claims of religions liberty, stop and consider the very real possibility that your actions are actualy enabling the very opposite of what you think will be the outcome. In the process you are handling over all your authority, necessary for people to even consider the Good News, let alone follow Jesus.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve responded <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/196">to this question</a> about &ldquo;what does one do with ideas&rdquo; with my wish for how products like Roam could be even better for me. In summary, I want an app like Roam that recognizes a string of text as the same as the title of an already existing page and automactically converts it to a link to that page without my having to specify it as such with square brackets.</p>

<p>I think the challenge is putting the &ldquo;new idea&rdquo; in a place that is connected/related in a way that easily re-surfaces. A common practice is to put all ideas in to one bucket/tickler file and then continually reviewing that bucket/tickler file, which itself requires discipline.</p>

<p>Roam has a nice feature that enables me to easily associate text to a future date so when that date arrives the app automatically displays that item. Roam isn&rsquo;t unique in this feature and associating to dates is probably an easy problem to solve, but what I would like would be an automated way associate an idea to a topic that can re-surface whenever I search for or write about the topic.</p>

<p>The closest example I can think of is glossary function in Fargo or wiki links in Roam but even those require remembering special functions, quotes for glossary, square brackets for wiki links. What I would love is to be able to tell software, whenever I write this string of text automatically convert the text to a hyperlink to this page of more information about it. For software to just do it for me it would have to constantly monitor my writing, like MS Word&rsquo;s spell/grammar check.</p>

<p>If memory serves, the closest experience I had to this was VoodooPad and WikiWikiWeb were you wrote in wikiwords like WhereIPutIdeas, that the software automatically converted to links, but that is flawed by the fact that one has to write in an unnatural way.</p>

<p>I guess what I want is some form of natural language processing of all text I write that queries against a collection of previously written pages and automatically links to matches. Even the backlinking in Roam requires some thinking/recollection on my part, unless there is something in Roam I have not yet discovered.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/11/28/i-think-that.html">On Saturday I wrote</a> that I think the real root cause behind why so many align themselves with Trump is the lack of good paying jobs that don&rsquo;t require a college degree. In his recent column for the New York Times, titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/26/opinion/republican-disinformation.html">The Rotting of the Republican Mind</a>, David Brooks pretty much writes the same thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under Trump, the Republican identity is defined not by a set of policy beliefs but by a paranoid mind-set&hellip;.You can’t argue people out of paranoia. If you try to point out factual errors, you only entrench false belief. The only solution is to reduce the distrust and anxiety that is the seedbed of this thinking. That can only be done first by contact, reducing the social chasm between the members of the epistemic regime and those who feel so alienated from it. And second, it can be done by policy, by making life more secure for those without a college degree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, while Brooks is putting the focus on Republican&rsquo;s, I think the same challenge lies with Democrats. The problem is that Trump and the Republican party really haven&rsquo;t done anything about the problem because they can&rsquo;t see the root cause, which I think is a combination of corporate greed by way of profit margins and a long history of anti-inflation that has conditioned us to seek out the lowest price for items we buy. (Have you ever enjoyed the thrill of finding a bargain?) I don&rsquo;t think either party is willing and able to do what is needed to address this issue.</p>

<p>As a thought exercise ask yourself, why is it that so many of the products you use every day are manufactured outside of the United States? (If you can find a label, take a look at it to see whether I am right or wrong.)</p>

<p>Many politicians of both parties will have you believe the problem is unfair trade practices by countries like China, which is the thinking behind Trump&rsquo;s tariffs that really did not result in more manufacturing jobs in the United States. Trade is a problem, but it&rsquo;s not the only problem.</p>

<p>Corporations do not manufacture in the United States because it costs more to manufacture items in the United States and what does that mean? Higher costs result in lower profit margins and if corporations want to maintain margins, which shareholders want them to do, then they have to increase the price of their products, but the problem with that is U.S. consumers do not like to pay higher prices. It appears something has to give, either corporations take lower profits or consumers pay higher prices. (And equally important because nearly everyone who can save for retirement does with either IRAs or 401ks is that a good number of the shareholders demanding margins that increase stock price are consumers of the products being manufactured.)</p>

<p>Can corporations and shareholders be convinced to live with lower profit margins for the sake of the country? Can consumers be convinced to pay more for items &ldquo;made in the U.S.A.&rdquo;? Can US manufacturing costs, a high portion of which is labor, be decreased?</p>

<p>You see here then the issue, there is no silver bullet, instead there is a need for a comprehensive solution that requires compromise by all parties. Democrats have to be willing to decrease regulations that increase manufacturing costs and Republicans have to be willing to work toward removing corporations&rsquo; burden of providing healthcare to its employees, which also increases the costs of labor. Serious discussion needs to occur within corporations and their boards of what is a fair profit margin and not just what they can drive the market toward (the starting point might be, what is a fair wage for CEOs?) and there needs to be a significant and continuous, buy made in the USA, marketing campaign to try to influence consumer purchasing.</p>

<p>The irony in all of this is that there was a time when both Republicans and Democrats campaigned on jobs, and jobs/the economy is still the issue now more than ever. The reason why Trump is popular is that his rhetoric and scapegoating resonates with the fear many Americans, particularly those without college degrees, feel. Scapegoating is an addictive drug, one feels good about &ldquo;sticking to it to the libretards,&rdquo; but when/if one looks around for change they will find no change to be found. Consequently, the only option that Republicans seem to have embraced is to keep the rhetoric going so that everyone stays happy enough to keep voting for the people placing the blame, which is themselves.</p>

         	<p>Too many of us are going to be affected directly or indirectly by COVID-19. I personally know four people that contracted the virus, had symptoms, and recovered although it took time. Unfortunately, the mother of a childhood friend died. I expect these numbers will increase, and I am not OK with that, but unfortunately not enough people share that same point of view. The United States of America is the only country in the world that puts perceived liberties over the reality of life and thinks it is better than every other country in the world. It&rsquo;s not patriotic or christian, it&rsquo;s hubris.</p>

         	<p>I am pondering the automatic keyboard lighting of the <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/ipad-magic-keyboard">Apple iPad Magic Keyboard</a>, which is based on ambient lighting and seems to be similar to the lighting adjustment on phones and tablets. Right now I am using the keyboard in a very well lit room and therefore I don’t need the keyboard on maximum brightness, but it is and that seems to align to phone screen brightness. You want phone screen brightness to increase outdoors so that you can read the screen, but it seems to me the backlighting of a physical keyboard should be the exact opposite, near zero in bright light, to save battery, and increase in brightness in darker rooms.</p>

         	<p>I think that despite <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/">the analysis of the election</a> around urban/rural and college educated/uneducated the common denominator is jobs. In the United States today it&rsquo;s nearly a given that in order for one to get a good paying job they must have a college degree. It also happens that those jobs are in urban areas. Further, while in the past there were plenty of good paying jobs in manufacturing that didn&rsquo;t require college degrees, we manufacture less in the U.S. than before so an increasing majority of jobs not requiring degrees are in services. Service industries don&rsquo;t pay high wages and are dependent on many external factors, which is why COVID has been so devastating to people in the U.S.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see one solution to the problem, the solution is a combination of decreasing the cost of getting a college degree, increasing existing service industry wages, and somehow increasing manufacturing in the United States. We must seek out and agree upon the incentives for doing each.</p>

<p>I understand the argument made that the government can&rsquo;t make restrictions on churches that they don&rsquo;t make on secular institutions.

         	<p>I ordered an open box / reduced price Apple Magic keyboard from Best Buy that I just received. Normally I don&rsquo;t order refurbished items, but I felt an accessory like a keyboard ought to be safe, and after combining the reduced price with some credit card reward points I got $100 reduced on the price.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to the unboxing, cut through the shrink wrap, open the box and all you find is the keyboard inside. I was surprised, given that this was a refurb, that the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; protected plastic wrap was on the keyboard.</p>

<p>There is literally no documentation in the box, I&rsquo;ve had to use Google to learn about some of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096">the standard keyboard shortcuts</a> given that there is no function key row.</p>

<p>I am sitting on a couch with the keyboard with iPad on my lap, typing as I would using any notebook computer. The keyboard is smaller, which is not a surprise given that this is the 11-inch model, but still, I can touch type just fine.</p>

<p>A few things to figure out. There is one function key, a key labeled with a globe at the lower left, that seems to be for selecting emojis, surely there is a way to change that? So far I haven&rsquo;t found one, although I have found some articles of useful information that I summarize below.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://medium.com/indica/i-lived-through-a-coup-america-is-having-one-now-437934b1dac3">The coup</a> has been in progress for four years, and probably even for more years than that. It most recently started with an assault on facts, starting with the numbers of people who did not attend President Trump’s inauguration, continued through three years of assaulting the press, nearly one year of an assault on science and medicine, and now with the assault on the heart of democracy, the election.</p>

<p>The risk is not who will be seated as President on January 21, 2021. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-birther-myth-stuck-around-for-years-the-election-fraud-myth-might-too/">The damage has already been done</a>, going forward all elections will likely be questioned probably until someone comes up with the bright idea of just not having them.</p>

<p>All of this is on the hands of Republicans. To those who say Trump has the right to have his day “in court” I say, when did elections become about courts? There is a phrase, just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should do it. Do you not see the damage you are doing to our country? For now on tens of millions of people will no longer trust elections because you continue to sow the seed of doubt, and for what? So that you can retain power? Did Washington, Madison, Hamilton, and Jefferson fight for power? Did Lincoln give his life for power or did he do it to preserve the Republic? The party of Lincoln indeed.</p>

<p>Here is a fact. What is common between Nixon and Trump is that they are both Republican. One resigned before being impeached and then pardoned, the other was impeached and could still be pardoned. The two most undemocratic Presidents of my lifetime, Republicans.</p>

<p>And finally, to those Regan Republicans, most of whom are of my generation. The USSR had elections, in fact most socialist dictatorships have elections. In the USSR (and now Russia) the outcome of the election was assured before the first vote cast because the person in power could not lose. What makes democratic elections, such as the ones we claim to have in the United States, is that the person in power (the incumbent) can lose. It’s not just about a peaceful transition of power, it’s about accepting the will of the people.</p>

<p>Republican actions right now are saying loudly, they do not accept the will of the people, and in doing they delegitimize their claim as a party of a free and democratic United States of America.</p>

         	<p>It seems to me that another fundamental to our democracy is the fact  that a person can lose an election. Buried in Trump&rsquo;s claims of election fraud is the idea that he couldn&rsquo;t lose so because he did it must be illegit. It&rsquo;s like Putin going into his &ldquo;elections&rsquo; knowing he will win, except at least this time in the United States Trump does not have Putin&rsquo;s style measures in place to create no doubt about the outcome. In the Unitied States anyone running for office who thinks they cannot lose demonstrates their lack of knowledge or unwillingness to accept the very thing that makes America great! The very thing that makes Trump dangerous is that he sees himself as an autocrat, and such a person should never come close to holding the office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what is America after Trump? A nation figuring out how — and whether — to engage and whom to love: the stranger or the self? I know the cynic’s prediction of which we’ll choose, but pure cynicism is boring. I’m rooting for a change but planning for a stasis.&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It should be clear that Democrats need to work on their strategy for Presidential elections. If one is willing to listen to me, I have the following observations.</p>

<p>Simply getting out the vote will not work. It seems the conclusion drawn from 2016 is that Clinton lost because not enough Democrats voted. The thinking is based on the belief there are more Democrats than Republicans in the United States. The problem is, increating vote count only works in a pure democratic nationwide election, aka the popular vote, and we don&rsquo;t elect Presidents in the United States by popular vote. (The founders feared a pure democracy.)</p>

<p>Republicans have simplified the path to the White House: win rural votes by &gt; 50% margin and if you get 30% of the urban vote, you win, and that strategy aligns to the electoral college. In short, Democrats have to get more rural vote, which leads me to the one overriding fundamental that Democrats have to understand..</p>

<p><strong>Fear of socialism trumps everything else!</strong></p>

<p>People are not really voting on issues, which I think is why polling is not working. People are voting on fear and mostly fear of the other side. The Republican message is simple, Democrats are socialists, socialism = communism = evil = unAmercan, so vote Republican to save America!  A significant number of people are convinced they can never vote for a Democrat because that is a vote for Socialism. Add to that another significant number of people, call them evangelicals, who are convinced voting for a Demorat is a vote for killing babys and you have this result. And evangelials equate socialism to atheism which adds another reason why they fear Democrats. Then, sadly, add to the fact that there are too many who fear a vote for a Democrat is a vote for people of color over white people.</p>

<p>If you consider that Republican votes are mostly all about fear of what Democrats will do, I think you see how the Democrat primary and compaigns of 2016 and 2020 make the election strategy for Republicans easy because policies considered to be socialist AND politicians considered to be socialists (Bernie Sanders) dominated the campaigns.</p>

<p>In short, I think Bernie Sanders created a lot of fear among voters AND was a easy target. Even after Biden secured the nomination Republicans simply claimed Sanders would have significant influence over Biden because Democrats do want the Sanders followers support. I think this is true, hard to dispute and personally frustrating to me because Bernie is not even a Democrat!</p>

<p>Why does this matter? It matters because for extremism to be successful it needs an equally extreme opposite. The antidote to extremism is the middle and unfortunately that is shrinking rapidly. I think the only way the middle, call them moderates, can be recovered is via a third party but how we finance and run elections in the United States in the 21st century really makes it impossible for a viable third party.</p>

<p>In summary, fear of socialism trumps everything. It don&rsquo;t matter whether the Republican candidate is authoritarian, unqualified, and incapable of leading, it only matters that at Democrat doesn&rsquo;t get power and destroy the country.</p>

         	<p>It seems to me that in order to have progress we need some agreement on what are the big problems. Many people think government itself, it&rsquo;s very existence, is the big problem, and they equate Democrats with pro government and pro big government. Others see that government as necessary, the problem is that it is not as effective as it should be. These others are Democrats and used to be a good number of Republicans too.</p>

         	<p>&ldquo;The founders were well aware of the dangers of populism, demagoguery, and faction. They built a constitutional order designed to force compromise and impede sociopathic behavior. But the institutions they put in place to act as gatekeepers (the Electoral College, the appointed Senate) became obsolete, and the successor gatekeepers (political bosses, smoke-filled rooms, big media) came to seem undemocratic and lost their grip. Today, the road to power for a sociopath or demagogue is comparatively unobstructed. As a result, the fail-safes designed to protect the system when the settings go out of alignment have themselves begun to fail.&rdquo; (nationalaffairs.com, <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/rethinking-polarization?smid=nytcore-ios-shar">Rethinking Polarization</a>)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/10/16/covid-is-the.html">Accepting Deaths</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/10/16/covid-is-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-10-16 14:30:00 -0400">Oct 16, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>COVID-19 is <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/top-causes-death-united-states-heart-disease-cancer-and-covid-19/">the third highest cause of death</a> in the United States from February to October of 2020.  One of the problems we have is how people are viewing these deaths. Rather than viewing them as an &ldquo;event&rdquo; caused death, like 9/11, people are viewing as a disease caused death, like heart disease, cancer, and strokes. In this case they are thinking, hundreds of thousands of people die from disease every year and this is the same.</p>

<p>The reason why this matters is that some people who view these deaths as similar to other diseases are more willing to view the 200K+ deaths as acceptable, but what they are not taking in to account is that all of the other diseases on the list have known preventative measures, treatments, and expected impacts, whereas we have none of these for COVID-19. The number of deaths of the other diseases would be higher each year if not for the years and years worth of science to lower the risk.</p>

<p>Further, neither heart disease or cancer, which are the two higher causes of death so far this year, are something in which a health person contracts the disease and can die in a matter of days or even weeks.</p>

<p>The point is that we should all be angry about the number of people who have died from COVID-19, particularly if we claim to place a high value on life. Surely, like all other places around the world, some people would have died no matter what, but nobody should view 200K+ deaths as acceptable and the problem is there is not true end in sight because there is zero leadership in the United States toward anything that resembles a plan.</p>

<p>The closest to what appears to be the plan is to just let the disease run its course. Perhaps another 100+ or more people will die, and too many people are ok with that so long as they can go wherever and do whatever they want to do. Meanwhile other nations in the world took active measures and controlled the very same disease we seem unwilling to fight, and did so for the sake of everyone in their country!</p>

<p>For people who want to put country over seemingly anything else, I don&rsquo;t know how they can be proud of how we, the United States, is handling this crisis.</p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conservaties believe that the natural rights enumerated above are paramount to any and all laws, orders, and rulings of the U.S. government. The pandemic raises the question though of whether the right to liberty, which appears to be translated by most as meaning the right to do anything they want, stands above the right to life.</p>

<p>Ironic isn&rsquo;t it, that as we begin to witness another series of SCOTUS confirmation hearings, we are witnessing this very debate in which Republicans insist that the right to life is paramount over the liberty of a woman to choose what to do with her body. No matter then the hypocrisy of these same Republicans insisting their right to liberty is paramount over everyone else&rsquo;s right to life. Well, if you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-sen-mike-lee-says-rank-democracy-bad-for-america-2020-10">seek the common denominator</a> you might find there really isn&rsquo;t any hypocricy.</p>

         	<p>It seems logical to me that the number of cases of COVID-19 will increase as the weather gets colder in the northern United States causing people to spend more time indoors without good ventilation. <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2020/10/11/michigan-again-at-high-risk-for-virus-outbreak-amid-worry-of-2nd-wave-data-shows/">A report</a> over the weekend appears to provide the statistical evidence, the R0, or rate of infection, has jumped to 1.12, you want it to be below 1. Daily new cases per 100,000 people is 11.7, a number above 10 is considered high. The good news is that ICU occupancy is low so for now hospitals appear to be capable of meeting demand, but an increase in the rate of spread increases the probability of people with pre-existing conditions who catch the virus need hospitalization. Lending further support to the &ldquo;colder weather&rdquo; theory is the fact that the new Michigan outbreak is in the Upper Peninsula.</p>

<p>Given the Michigan Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision that the Governor has over-stepped her authority with her efforts to contain the disease and the Republican party&rsquo;s preference to not issue mandates, it is likely the spread will increase unless citizens self comply or take county and city health orders seriously. I expect the State Legislature to pass legislation to prevent counties and cities from issuing their own health orders.</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/10/08/outlines-wikis-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-10-08 10:45:00 -0400">Oct 8, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have a great deal of respect for the people who layed the foundation of the computer technology I use today, people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/">Dan Bricklin</a>, <a href="http://about.fed.wiki/view/ward-cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>, and <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>. I follow Ward and Dave the closest because they actively write and because I use their work every day.</p>

<p>I am struck by the similarities and differences  between Ward and Dave&rsquo;s work. Ward created wiki, which is a tool he created to write and share pattern languages. Wiki&rsquo;s emphasis is on easy writing and hyperlinking, which I think was the intended purpose of the Web. Dave also created writing tools, the outliner and blogs, that simplify publishing of writing on the Internet and he also created RSS to make it easier for one to keep up with the writing on the Internet. Dave&rsquo;s original work is the conceptual basis for <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my stream</a> while Ward&rsquo;s original work provides the tools for <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">my garden</a>.</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/">outlines</a> and find that I really like <a href="https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki">Federated Wiki</a> and today I realized that the similarity between them is that both provide context to writing but in different ways. Outlines are hiearchical while Federated Wiki has a lineup that shows context between source and destination links in a horizontal and linear fashion. I think this ability to easily see context and connections is also why I like <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> and use it for my private notes.</p>

<p>I am not sure that this matters much to others, but I think there is a relationship between context and history. History is the context of our lives and I think a great deal of our problems come from a failure to see meaning or to see what is really happening because we fail to know the context. Part of the problem may be that it&rsquo;s too difficult to find the context of history, that&rsquo;s where tools like oultliners might help, and because it is so difficult few people really take the time to seek out and understand context.</p>

<p>Context is needed for true understanding, knowledge, and thus wisdom and today there is a huge deficiency of wisdom.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.pairagraph.com/">Pairagraph</a> is an interesting site, with an interesting starting dialog about whether America is in decline that <a href="https://www.pairagraph.com/dialogue/fc2f8d46f10040d080d551c945e7a363/2">Om Malik is participating in</a>.  I find my reaction is less about whether or not I agree with Om as much as the fact that he appears to associate Amercia&rsquo;s not decline with wealth. Fixation on wealth as a measure of success is a uniquely human problem that is becoming more problematic, particularly for the United States. Should freedom and liberty be defined in wealth terms?</p>

<p>As to the site&hellip; why couldn&rsquo;t the dialog occur between two people writing on their own blogs?</p>

         	<p>The same people who are convinced that the media and Democrats are making COVID-19 more than it is are the same people convinced that U.S. elections are highly corrupt. They call out as propaganda that which they do not want to hear nor accept but don&rsquo;t apply the same criteria against those of their own tribe. When it comes to elections, start with a fact that the people currently in office do not want high voter turnouts, while everyone should be embarrassed that nearly half of Americans do not vote.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/price-drop-grab-the-lenovo-usi-stylus-for-only-32/">The Lenovo USI Stylus</a> arrived today, giving me the first chance to try a <a href="https://universalstylus.org/">Universal Stylus Initiative</a> digital pen. Historically, digital pens only work with the tablets made by the manufacturer of the pen, and the pens are not portable between tablets. USI is a protocol intended to enable one to use a pen across multiple tablets. Thus, the Lenovo stylus I just got is supposed to not only work with the Lenovo Duet, but other tablets and notebook computers that support USI.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have another device that supports USI, but I can say that the stylus I received just worked with the Duet once I got the pen powered up, there was no pairing process. The problem that I have with this stylus is that its tip is too big and round and so writing with it is like writing with a used medium tip marker rather than like a fine point pen. The tip on the Apple Pencil and Microsoft Surface Pen is much more like a pencil or pen so that what you write on the screen does not look like big fat characters.</p>

<p>The upside to the Lenovo USI is that it only cost me $31, which is considerabily cheaper than the Apple Pencil. However, even if it is cheap, the fact that one cannot really write digital ink that approximates a fine tip pen will hinder its usefullness.</p>

         	<p>I am thinking that the state of COVID-19 in the United States may be less of a failure of leadership than we want to think. Imagine if this happened while Obama were President. Yes, the response would be more efficient, like hospital supplies would be better managed, but I think the people refusing to do the right things now, like wearing masks and social distancing, would refuse to do them with Obama as President.The same Republican Governors and state legislatures would do the same thing they are doing now.</p>

<p>In many ways the U.S. response to COVID-19 is the same as how respond to mass shootings, no matter where they occur. We are trapped in a selfish, individualistic mindset fueled by capitalists and religious and taken advantage of by the power brokers.</p>

         	<p>It is possible that Trump will recover well from his bout with COVID-19, which will then result with his supporters declaring, &ldquo;see, no worse than the flu!&rdquo; We must not obsess on how this affects Trump personally and focus on how it spreads and affects others. Trump <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/z_pyAge2r_k/index.html">and those directly in his orbit</a> do not care about others, and apparently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/notre-dame-white-house-coronavirus/2020/10/02/7b1a38a0-051d-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html">people who should know better</a>, like college professors and presidents, as if in an abusive relationship, are too intimidated to stand for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/03/politics/chris-christie-coronavirus/index.html">Chris Christie</a>, for the sake of your family and your own life, stop hanging out with President Trump!</p>

<p>The purpose of wearing a mask is so that one may not spread the virus to others. Because Trump has demonstrated he does not care at all for others, anyone coming in close physical contact with him is putting their life in danger. This act alone is a violation of Trumps oath of office, but since grown ups who identify Republican were incapable of standing up to him and removing him from office when they had the chance, they get to suffer the consequences. (Republicans, when will you face the fact that Trump is not one of you and doesn&rsquo;t care about you?)</p>

<p>Isolate Trump in the White House until after the election.  No more tax dollars spent on him to spread the virus around. <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/0MQ3Hs42rKk/index.html">No more press conferences</a>. No rallies. Enough is enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strategically speaking, it weakens any credibility that the US has, in terms of being a competent global leader prepared to confront threats. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Making America Great? Greatness is not self declared, it is determined by consensus of others. If I say I am great, I am being arrogant. America&rsquo;s greatness is thus truly determined by the people who live in countries other than the United States of America.</p>

<p>We were first considered great in 1787 when we did something never done before by creating a nation governed by citizens rather than ruled by monarchs. Any doubt was removed by the end of World War II when we saved the world from fascism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we got drunk on our own press clippings, puffed our chest, and started trying to impose our superiority upon the world, first in Korea, then in Vietnam, and as we started losing the &ldquo;war&rdquo; in Vietnam the government declared war on its own citizens, which has been raging toward the near boiling point that we are experiencing now.</p>

<p>It turns out to be great you do have to care about others. Nobody ever thought to be great was so self centered as to not be willing to sacrifice for the other.</p>

         	<p>Last year <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/09/30/another-goat-on.html">I speculated</a> that David Ross would be hired to manage the Cubs and wondered how well he would do. I think he has done a good job, but the issues about the Cub&rsquo;s lineup persists. A team of Home Run hitters can be easily stopped by good pitching. Fortunately, this season was short enough so that their early lead held, but I don&rsquo;t  think they win their division if they played a full schedule.</p>

         	<p>I am beginning to think that Apple&rsquo;s decision to split iPadOS from iOS is a bad decision. While it makes total sense why Scribble is only in iPadOS, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/ios-and-ipados-14-review-iphone-transformation-ipad-iteration/">it makes absolutely no sense</a> why one cannot place widgets on a iPadOS home screen, nor does it have the App Library. Their exclusion seems arbitrary as if Apple feels obligated to keep features out so that the OSes are different. The net result, however, is a worse user experience.</p>

<p>In a society that is growing radically more secular every day, I’d say we have more to fear from political dogmatism than religious dogmatism. We have more to fear from those who let their politics determine their faith practices and who turn their religious communities into political armies. We have more to fear from people who look to politics as a substitute for faith.</p>

<p>Religion is that to which we bind ourselves to and I think it more human nature than we realize to bind ourselves to our tribes, whether they be churches, political parties, ideologies, football teams, and NASCAR racers. The problem is that we confuse faith with religion, they are related but different.</p>

         	<p>Here is a question that all Americans, particularly Republicans, should ask themselves. When Al Gore conceded the 2000 election, was he being a patriot by putting country over his personal ambitions or was he being weak?</p>

<p>And if you are Republican, honestly ask yourself if your answer would be different if Gore were a Republican.</p>

<p>As we head in to this Presidential election your answer to this question might be the most consequential one of your lifetime. A test of patriotism happens only when you put something bigger like your country above your own self interests like your tribe.</p>

         	<p>I am not surprised that Republican Senators who otherwise seem to oppose Trump, like Romney, are all in on getting their Supreme Court Justice approved. The whole reason why they have been tolerating Trump is to get those Justices and there is no way they are not going to claim that prize. Further, I think they see it it likely Trump will lose and it is possible they could lose the Senate, so that have to do it now or never. Republicans are long past the point where fairness matters, and their constituency is only their tribe and not Americans in general. From their point of view, given Supremes are for life, SCOTUS is their last chance to secure <strong>their way of life</strong> for the next decade.</p>

They must have a long term plan because I can&rsquo;t imagine there are high sales expectations given the price and COVID. So, there must be planned iterations that improve performance and get the price down to a point where it is more affordable to more people. The other thing to watch is, whether the Surface Neo sees the light of day. You might recall it as the larger &ldquo;booklet&rdquo; Surface that Panay showed last year, but it would run Windows 10x. My understanding is that the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview&amp;cid=msft_web_collection">Surface Pro X</a>, which is the ARM Surface, is not exactly flying out of stores.

A reason might be that not once did he refer to the price and thus didn&rsquo;t get in to the &ldquo;for this price one should not have these problems&rdquo; trope. IMHO any gadget priced north of $1K is too expensive even if it works perfectly!</p>

<p>So, if price is an issue, save the time and the pixels and just write, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too expensive&rdquo; and move on. Because Kevin is not on a mission to drive home the point that the device is too expensive, he focuses more on the actual problems and frankly, what he writes about seem to be something that Microsoft could address in software updates.</p>

<p>The most important point that Kevin makes, though, is about the biases toward what the Duo is, even though Microsoft has emphasized it is not a phone or a tablet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think people are calling the Duo a phone because that&rsquo;s the closest device comparison they can make. And I get that. But the Duo truly is something different and, along with other folding or swivel screen devices, early in the trend of a new device class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I like this thought&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And although Microsoft dubbed it the Duo over a year ago, I think the company should have said that &ldquo;Duo&rdquo; is just an internal product code name. A better, more descriptive name would have been Surface Booklet because that&rsquo;s really what it is: A connected book-like tablet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/09/11/it-is-easy.html">I noted before</a> that Brad Sams also took effort to emphasize the Duo being a class on its own, although he used device classification of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).</p>

<p><a href="https://petri.com/surface-duo-review-the-pursuit-of-productivity">Brad Sams&rsquo; review of the Microsoft Duo</a> is the first I&rsquo;ve seen that calls it a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which I suspect is a better categorization than smartphone or tablet. The problem again comes back to price, it&rsquo;s just way too expensive and doesn&rsquo;t not provide enough for that expensive beyond being a niche product.  My hope is that Microsoft and Google don&rsquo;t give up on it too soon and find a way to get the price down.</p>

         	<p>Based on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review">my read</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html">a few</a> of the Microsoft Duo reviews, which are negative, I see that they are written in the context of the device&rsquo;s $1400 price. Compare reviews of the Google Pixel 4a and the Microsoft Duo, in some ways they are the same, but because the 4a only costs $350 the issues are understandable or overlooked. Devices priced at $1k or higher need to be perfect; the Duo appears to be a beta, akin to Google Glass.</p>

         	<p>I believe the main message our brains ought to receive in how we see the pandemic treated in the United States and how we see the contempt of life of those other than me is that the sin we are trapped in is the egoistic obsession with wealth. For example, have you stopped to consider why the checks the government gave at earlier this year were called &ldquo;stimulus checks&rdquo;?</p>

While I think Woodward withheld what he learned earlier in the year for the sake of book sales, I am not convinced that reporting what he had or even playing the tapes would have made any difference. Republican Senators had plenty of evidence to find Trump guilty and ignored that for sake of party, THEY are the ones most at fault for the loss of lives and we ought not forget it. At this point the only remedy is to vote Trump out of office.</p>

         	<p>&ldquo;Just remember this: no one can keep you from the second half of your own life except yourself. Nothing can inhibit your second journey except your own lack of courage, patience, and imagination. Your second journey is all yours to walk or to avoid. My conviction is that some falling apart of the first journey is necessary for this to happen, so do not waste a moment of time lamenting poor parenting, lost job, failed relationship, physical handicap, gender identity, economic poverty, or even the tragedy of any kind of abuse. Pain is part of the deal. If you don&rsquo;t walk into the second half of your own life, it is you who do not want it. God will always give you exactly what you truly want and desire. So make sure you desire, desire deeply, desire yourself, desire God, desire everything good, true, and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/08/19/computing-is-art.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-08-19 10:20:24 -0400">Aug 19, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve read two articles this week that make the case for treating Computer Science as something other than Computer Science. The one, titled, <a href="https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/8/246368-why-computing-belongs-within-the-social-sciences/fulltext">Why Computing Belongs With The Social Sciences</a>, argues that we will not gain more ethical computing from college curricula that have &ldquo;Computing Ethics&rdquo; classes but only by moving Computing in to the Social Sciences. The author points to the increasing relationship between algorithms and power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recommendation algorithms, automated sanctioning systems, reactive violation detection and prediction systems, and nudge architectures are replacing the human agency built into our legal and political systems with an architecture of unknowable black boxes allowing the one-way surveil and control of people without any corresponding contestation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an essay titled <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters</a>, Paul Graham notes that while he graduated with a Computer Science degree, he self identifies as a hacker, which is the likely image most people have of one who holds a CompSci degree. Graham says that hackers are like painters and writers because they make things. The following is for me the most important quote in the essay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one. Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are practically solipsists. It&rsquo;s hard for such people to design great software [5], because they can&rsquo;t see things from the user&rsquo;s point of view</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both articles resonate strongly with me. I graduated in 1989 with a Computer Science degree and have been working in the Information Technology industry for more than thirty years and I can say that I have never used any of the specifics of my computer science classes save for one, one Software Engineering. I also got a minor in secondary education and what gained from that part of my college learning I applied frequently throughout my career.</p>

<p>In my experience computing is more art than a science and more about humans than machines and yet neither of these realities were part of my formal computer science education. Granted, much time has passed since I graced the college classrooms so I know curricula has changed, but yet given the &ldquo;market&rdquo; pressures on colleges I suspect the most focus on producing employable graduates, with life long skills a secondary benefit rather than primary focus.</p>

         	<p>Last year, about Chicago Cubs, <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/08/17/go-cubs-go.html">I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is not the hitting, although they could be more consistent. To me the problem is the bullpen, they are giving up too many runs in the 6 thru 9th innings. Nobody in the pen is reliable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could not imagine that at the same time a year later the Cubs would be playing under such strange circumstances like they will today, playing two seven inning games in a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; double-header. Yet, while the Cubs have the best record, the bullpen performance has not been much different.</p>

         	<p>The Chicago Cubs have now lost three games in a row. Normally that would not be a problem, but in a short season, it feels like they really need to win at least one game today against the Cardinals. Preferably win both.</p>

         	<p>It seems to me that comparing something that is intended to create a new category of device against current categories is flawed. My read of <a href="https://4thquadrant.io/freearticles/business-models/microsofts-surface-duo-not-a-product-review/">this take on the Microsoft Surface Duo</a> is that it is designed for productivity, smartphones are not designed for productivity, but we will compare it to smartphones anyway.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the real problem with the Surface Duo is its price. Anything that requires one to spend &gt;$1,000 demands more discretion. Right now the price is a barrier to entry that is going to prevent Microsoft from selling many units.</p>

         	<p>In a blog post today Om Malik asks, <a href="https://om.co/2020/08/13/gig-economy-work/">What is work?</a> and I think he touches on a root cause of Trumpism. Basically, many people have a hard time seeing a future in which they have a good paying job and nobody seems to have an answer. Democrats are supposed to support labor via union representation, but instead appears to be in bed with corporations and the wealthy as much as Republicans. The traditional Republican Party has no better answers, leaving a vacuum that allows for the scapegoating that Trump promotes.</p>

<p>Except, scapegoating is itself a misdirection no different than anyone else because it puts focus on China and not on the corporations that use Chinese labor. Pick up anything and you will likely find a &ldquo;made in China&rdquo; sticker, but is that the fault of China or the &ldquo;American&rdquo; company who sell the product? And what if American&rsquo;s hunt for the bargain that pushes change companies toward low cost labor so they can maintain profit margins?</p>

         	<p>Perhaps the most important skill we learn in life is how we make decisions. Too little time is spent reflecting on this skill in ourselves, and evaluating it in leaders. How we see the world influences the decisions we make. If everything that happens is viewed through the lense of how it affects me personally, for example, does this help or hurt my chances for re-election, then most of the decisions I make are for my own self interest. (Note that very, very few people do NOT make any decisions in their self interest. I am talking about degree)</p>

<p>I suggest that over the course of history, those who history says are good leaders put common interest above their own in the moments that matter. For me the decision making process is a core competency of anyone who I consider to recognize as leader and who may gain my vote in an election.</p>

<p>Incumbents have the blessing or curse of having demonstrated how they make decisions, and thus tend to have an easier or sometimes bigger hurdle to overcome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A President needs to get Congress to pass legislation to implement his or her plans. Consequently we gauge their potential success of whether the President’s party has a majority in the House and Senate. Reality is that this rarely happens, and even so there may be members of the President’s own party who don’t agree, therefore what we need to evaluate is how persuasive a candidate is and whether they can lead compromise.</p>

         	<p>I just transferred music I had uploaded to Google Play Music to YT Music because Google is shutting down Play Music next month. A few years ago I had uploaded all the music I had ripped from CDs to Play Music as a form of online backup, and I always appreciated the fact that I could access that music using the Play Music app on my Android devices, and I can cast my music to any of my Chromecasts and Google Home devices. Much to my surprise and disappointment, I have found that YT Music only lets me cast music to one of my Chromecast devices and tells me if I want to cast to others, like Google Home, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/54547361?hl=en">I need to upgrade to premium</a>.

         	<p>I am one of the many people who used and really liked the DarkSky weather app on Android. While the Android app is great, the main reason why I bought the premium subscription was for the Wear OS app. Now that Apple bought DarkSky and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/android-version-of-popular-dark-sky-weather-app-shuts-down/">shutdown the Android app</a>, I&rsquo;ve lost the DarkSky app and complications on my watch.</p>

<p>I switched to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accuweather.android&amp;hl=en_US">the AccuWeather app</a> on my smartphone, but while it does have a Wear OS component, it is really bad in comparison to DarkSky and doesn&rsquo;t have complications. I am hoping AccuWeather beefs up the Wear OS app over time. The whole DarkSky aquisition by Apple was really disappointing.</p>

         	<p>Today is a primary election day here in Michigan and we voted from home for the first time. Some notes regarding voting from home now that I experienced it first hand. First, while it is most often referred to as &ldquo;vote by mail&rdquo; one can actually hand deliver their ballots at the township clerk&rsquo;s office. In my case the township have several outside, 24x7 lock boxes and an internal (available during business hours) lock box. The point being, one is not constrained to using the USPS for delivery of their ballot. Second is that if I am honest, we probably would not have voted in this election because it is a primary, so &ldquo;voting from home&rdquo; caused me to participate in government as intended.</p>

The con is all about sowing doubt, and the fact that a POTUS is even willing to suggest it says all that one needs to know. Trump never has understood nor appreciated the Constitution nor the Republic for which it stands, and that was known at the time when he was impeached by the House. In fact, it&rsquo;s basically why he WAS IMPEACHED! Republicans have been aiding the con since he took office and had a chance to do the right thing in the impeachment trial.

         	<p>“The Christian life is not about believing or doing what we need to believe or do so that we can be saved. Rather, it’s about seeing what is already true—that God loves us already—and then beginning to live in this relationship. It is about becoming conscious of and intentional about a deepening relationship with God.”</p>

         	<p>If you start with the premise that there is a relationship between privacy and liberty, then you might find it ironic that Europe has overcome the United States as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">the world advocate for liberty</a>. The United States has been in the process of becoming a police state since the early 1970s, when the Federal government started viewing some U.S. citizens as enemy combatants under slogans like &ldquo;War On Drugs&rdquo; and &ldquo;War On Crime.&rdquo;  And despite thoughts to the contrary, Trump is all in on the evolving police state just like former U.S. Presidents or representatives.</p>

         	<p>I see <a href="https://twitter.com/RexChapman/status/1283153317095505920">a video snippet</a> of Mike Pence saying &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want CDC guidance to be a reason for not opening schools.&rdquo; First reaction is WTF not?</p>

<p>The second reaction is that there are two big issues at play here. One is &ldquo;anti-elitism,&rdquo; which is a point of view of which there are no experts to trust, everyone should just &ldquo;go with their gut&rdquo; or &ldquo;use common sense.&rdquo; In most Republican circles &ldquo;elites&rdquo; are Democrats or liberals to be ignored out right.</p>

<p>The second issue is relationship between federal and local governments. It&rsquo;s clear that the Republicans in charge right now think there is no legitimate role for the federal government beyond defense. In their eyes the federal government has no responsibility for solving &ldquo;big problems&rdquo; of the nation. In some ways their view of government is more Articles of Confederation than U.S. Constitution. (I find it ironic that a Conservative group calls themselves The Federalist Society but acts more anti-federalist.)</p>

<p>Stated differently, current Republicans take Reagan&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;The Federal government is not the solution, the federal government is the problem&rdquo; very literally, and apparently lost on them is the irony that the words were spoken by a man seeking the position of being the top person of that federal government.</p>

I am a long time Chromebook user and own a Pixelbook, but the Duet is the first Chrome OS tablet I&rsquo;ve used and the first time that I&rsquo;ve installing other Android browsers like Brave. Chrome OS really doesn&rsquo;t like that there is more than one browser on the Duet because every time I click a hyperlink I get a prompt asking me which browser I want to open it in. There should be a way to override this so I can tell Chrome OS only open hyperlinks in Chrome and don&rsquo;t bother asking me, but I haven&rsquo;t found one it exists.</p>

         	<p>The irony of our time is that the phrase on those hats, &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; were prophetic four years ago. The problem is that Americans don&rsquo;t seem to understand that greatness is not self-declared. Greatness can be aspirational but for it to be so requires an understanding of how others define greatness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the eve of America’s anniversary—our two hundred and forty-fourth—much of the world believes that the country is racist, battered and bruised. “Europe has long been suspicious—even jealous—of the way America has been able to pursue national wealth and power despite its deep social inequities,” Robin Niblett, the director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, also known as Chatham House, in London, told me.</p>

It is interesting to use as a tablet because it is a rectangular shape rather than square and so it&rsquo;s much longer in portrait mode than I&rsquo;m used to in a tablet.

         	<p>I’ve made two purchases from Best Buy online since COVID-19, which is a bit unusual because I normally order from Amazon. What I am even more surprised by is that I prefer Best Buy’s shipping because they use UPS. I find Amazon’s in-house delivery random and unpredictable where as UPS deliveries are part of a regular route by the same guy at nearly the same time. Further, they provide GPS tracking of the delivery truck so I can see where my package is in route to my house on the day of delivery, which enables me to be ready to receive the package so it isn’t waiting outdoors. I also get text messages of the delivery status. Amazon provides notices but no real tracking. Further, since Amazon delivery is random, packages can end up in all sorts of strange places. Amazon saves money, but I find their customer service has taken a hit in the process.</p>

         	<p>In a way, Apple&rsquo;s move of Mac OS to ARM puts it  back into competition with Microsoft. Microsoft has been working to run Windows on ARM for a while, now Apple will start showing them how it is done, particularly in how it provides support for legacy applications, but also in how to seemlessly host mobile and desktop applications on the same platform. In this later case, Apple&rsquo;s OS strategy is moving closer to what Google has been doing with Chrome OS.</p>

         	<p>Apple announced Macs will run their own chips. Surprised to not see Intel&rsquo;s stock drop. OTOH, Macs only amount to 5% of Intel&rsquo;s chips. This will be the third major chip architecture change that Apple has made in it&rsquo;s life, but likely their last.</p>

         	<p>When I look at <a href="https://www.us-covid-tracker.com/">the charts</a> it&rsquo;s clear to me that we are in the midst of a second wave of COVID-19 in the United States. Sadly, for those who hoped that the cases would go down when temperatures went up, the hot spots for COVID-19 are all warm weather states on the first day of summer. Selfishly, I hope that Michiganders see what is going on around them and not give in to the temptation that this is over.</p>

<p>Today, I was thinking about our future post-pandemic reality. A contactless future is going to become obvious. With the retail and restaurant sectors struggling and shrinking, we will start seeing the places which make us part of a society, a neighborhood, humans begin to go away. A dry cleaner here, a coffee shop there. What will remain of society?</p>

<p>What I think we are actually seeing here is the consequences of a society build around capitalism. In such a society everything is defined by a value placed on it by a market rather than having innate value.</p>

         	<p>Unions have a place in protecting labor and there really is no institution that protects and advocates in behalf of labor than unions. Historically Democrats have been supported by unions because they tend to support pro-labor policies, but they aren&rsquo;t dedicated solely to labor. Democrats pushed NAFTA, which wasn&rsquo;t a good thing for labor in the U.S.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like everything in life, unions can be abusive. Like the idea taking a look at the scope of work for police departments, and perhaps thinking of ways to handle them differently, the same should be done with unions. We have to keep the good things that unions do and <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/09.html#a174718">not simply disband them</a>, in fact, I think we need stronger advocacy for ALL labor that includes both traditional blue collar and white collar jobs.</p>

Back when I wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Everything-Windows-Mobile/dp/B002IKLN6K">my books</a> I had to pay someone to create the index for the book. I assume then that was a person who used a tool to automatically produce an index of the book&rsquo;s content but then manually reviewed and edited the output to produce the final product. Not sure the production of a good index can be completely automated, but an automated one might be good enough.</p>

A competent politician should easily gain re-election in a time of national crisis simply by being a unifying force. The fact that he hasn&rsquo;t done so is a clear example of his incompetence that Republicans should really be concerned about. As much as we claim we don&rsquo;t like politicians and think anybody can be President, the basic skills needed for the job in a Democracy is political. You wouldn&rsquo;t hire a mechanic to fix your car who doesn&rsquo;t have the experience nor the skills to actually repair the car. Trump is not competent for the position of President of the United States.</p>

<p>The police and the U.S. military are separate institutions because policing a community and fighting a war are supposed to be separate jobs. In traditional “wars,” both sides are heavily armed. In Minnesota, only the agents of the state appear to be wearing body armor and carrying long guns. And yet: State officials are calling this “warfare” on official public channels.</p>

         	<p>I think the COVID-19 response exposes a problem with the current state of lack of trust created through an increase in extreme points of view, both left and right. Consequently, people now seem to only trust what they can see with their own eyes or what make sense to them. Therefore, people are less likely to take COVID-19 seriously until they are personally affected in some way.</p>

<p>For such people, <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144355">a young person&rsquo;s account of surviving COVID-19</a> published by the New York Times is not believed because they don&rsquo;t trust the New York Times. Likewise anything <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144838">published by the NewYorker</a>. <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144627">A blogger&rsquo;s first hand account</a> is meaningless because I don&rsquo;t know the blogger.</p>

<p>In short, the problem cannot be placed on external entities that are not trusted. The problem isn&rsquo;t with journalism not doing something so much as journalism having no credibility from an extremist point of view unless that journalist is identified as having the same extremist point of view.</p>

<p>Howard Stern echos something I&rsquo;ve said for a while, but I think what may be the case is that these people don&rsquo;t necessarily love Trump himself so much as what he represents to them, which they personally identify with. They see themselves in Trump&rsquo;s persona and thus any negative statement about him is translated as a personal attack in them. To these people we are deep within a class war between &ldquo;elites&rdquo; and what they believe are &ldquo;normal people,&rdquo; which they define as anyone who agrees with and acts like them, and which they call &ldquo;common sense.&rdquo; The war began when Newt Gingrich ascended to Speaker of the House.</p>

         	<p>I am one of many people who really like the note-taking app called <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> that is currently in beta. However, it seems some think that bidirectional note linking is the primary feature of Roam, and while I think bidirectional note linking is a differentiator it is not the only reason why I prefer Roam.  For me the main reason why I like Roam is that it is an outliner for developing and maintaining a wiki that automatically supports bidirectional links.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried <a href="https://www.amplenote.com/blog/bidirectional_note_linking_and_an_offer_for_roam_exporters">amplenote.com</a> that claims to be an alternate to Roam that supports bidirectional links, and I does in fact do a very good job of importing content from Roam. However, Amplenote is not an outliner and I quickly found that true outlining, not just bullet lists, is a must have requirement for me.</p>

         	<p>Corporations don’t want government to tell them what to do. They pay lots of money to politicians at all levels of government from POTUS to state representatives to make sure they can do whatever they want.

         	<p>I think the real problem with transitioning to the current state of lockdowns to something that resembles normal is that doing so requires cooperation from everyone to a degree that doesn’t seem possible today. It requires people to wear masks in public, to get tested, to stay home if they get sick and it will require people to be willing to get vaccinated when a vaccine becomes available.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we live in a world where selfishness and greed is the default expectation. In that world in which you cannot count on people to do the right thing, someone has to be a parent and that means the government.</p>

<p>I think what we are witnessing today is the result of the greed plus poor leadership equation. If this moment in history is to truly be a fork from the road we are heading down, we have got to start recognizing the greed within all of us and learn to understand what is enough, and we have got to start scrutinizing our leaders, particularly the leaders of our companies.</p>

<p>Little Outliner creates and edits outlines written in OPML, which is an XML-based file format for outlines that Dave created. If you only need to view and edit files, Little Outliner is all you need. Dave recently released <a href="http://my.this.how/davewiner/howtos.opml">a web service that renders an OPML file as a web page</a>, the net result is a simple way to create a nice looking web page. I&rsquo;ve decided to use this to create <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml">my /now page</a>, all I have to do is edit the file in Little Outliner. You will find the link to this page in the footer the pages on this site.</p>

<p>You may notice that the subheads in the page have a littlle upside down triangle, those are parent nodes of the source outline, the following indented text are children nodes. If you click the triangle the node will collapse, click it again and it expands. By default all of the nodes render as expanded but you can configure a node to collapse by default. Click node you want to configure as collapsed, then click the suitecase icon on the left toolbar, click the plus button on the Edit attributes window;  in the left field enter collapse, in the right field enter true, and then click Save. Refresh the web page and you see node/head you configured will be collapsed.</p>

         	<p>Trump seems to think the most important measure of his success is the stock market. The reality is that the stock market is driven significantly by emotions, either confidence (bull) or fear (bear). The only tool a President really has in relation to the stock market is his or her ability to lead. People know leadership when they see it, and they look for leadership for confidence and void of seeing such leadership have fear. Consequently, the stock market is telling us much of what we need to know about President Trump and that is he is not a leader, but this was obvious in 2016 to anyone willing to see beyond the theater perpetrated by Trump and everyone around him. After we get through this crisis I wonder whether we will truly place blame where it belongs, which is how a person of Trump&rsquo;s deep character flaws and probable mention disorder was elected. We need to truly look at how we elect Presidents and make changes&hellip;. that or Congress has to get a whole less political and much more representative of ALL Americas and execute it&rsquo;s oversight obligations given it by the Constitution. (The Senate had it&rsquo;s chance of saving tens of thousands of lives when it had the chance to remove Trump from office.)</p>

         	<p>“The relationship between America and China was not “normal” before COVID-19. It was in rapid decline. And that decline has left Americans more vulnerable to the disease. The lesson of this plague isn’t that America should stop cooperating with China. It’s that America must rebuild the public-health cooperation that the Trump administration helped destroy.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-china-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/">Trump’s Break With China Has Deadly Consequences</a></p>

<p>In November Americans will hopefully have the opportunity to decide whether to replace Trump as president and for that we not only need to assess how he and his administration handled this crisis, but also the ways in which he was responsible for it.</p>

<p>The isolationism he has been putting in place has contributed immensely to how bad COVID19 has been for the United States. As far as disease is concerned, imports and tariffs have nothing to do with it, rather it&rsquo;s about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html">the tremendous amount of global travel</a> that occurs every single day. Even if you restricted travel to China you can&rsquo;t stop the possibility of an American being in a conference room in Germany with a person who traveled there from China.</p>

<p>Isolationism does not work, that&rsquo;s the lesson the greatest generation learned and of which we are being reminded today. Let&rsquo;s heed the lessons well and revert to the wise decisions of prior administrations, Democrat and Republican.</p>

<p>Georgia-Pacific, a leading toilet paper manufacturer based in Atlanta, estimates that the average household will use 40% more toilet paper than usual if all of its members are staying home around the clock.

I&rsquo;ve been writing about the lessons we should learn from COVID-19, the biggest of which is that we are all connected such that a virus on the other side of the globe can find it&rsquo;s way to you in the United States. At the heart of this is putting our heads in the sand in the name of &ldquo;America First,&rdquo; which is the same mentality that existed prior to World War II and lead to World War II. As memories of the atrocities that occurred during during World War II fade we have been moving back in to an isolationist shell that puts all our lives in danger. Just because you don&rsquo;t like the implications of this does not mean ignoring will cause it to go away. It&rsquo;s time to wake up, put on our big boy and girl pants and deal with reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, governments and society by and large are governed by inertia. We don’t change and adapt and evolve very quickly. And we’re barely cognizant as a global society that the world we’re living in today is fundamentally different than the world our species has ever lived in. You know that old saw that if you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will leap out. But if you take that same frog and put it in a pot of ambient water and slowly crank up the temperature, it will stay in that water and boil to death. It loses perspective on the changing environment around it. We’re that frog in the ambient water. We’re oblivious to the conditions that have enabled zoonotic viruses to become integrated into us.</p>

<p>Right now your best chance at survival depends on how the governor of the state you live in is leading the response. It’s as if after Pearl Harbor we left it to the governor of Hawaii to deal with the response.</p>

His view of the world in which everything negative is an attack on him personally prevented him from seizing an opportunity true leaders would have ran toward. You have had plenty opportunities to learn about the failures of leadership, such as how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">George W.

         	<p>“What American pundits misunderstand when they brandish “market choice” as a weapon against social welfare, then, is that the social safety net does not extinguish human freedom but instead acts as its very condition of possibility (philosophers have called this the distinction between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom). <strong>Indeed, the best safeguard against the novel coronavirus is the ability to voluntarily withdraw oneself from capitalism.</strong> Therein lies the problem.”</p>

<p>Industries that employ hourly labor make up the majority of capitalism in the United States, and most of the jobs these people fill cannot be done from home. If these people don&rsquo;t get paid, they don&rsquo;t have the freedom to buy. One of the main reasons for the drops in the stock market is the decrease in consumption of items being sold, not because products cannot be produced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moment we no longer have a free press, anything can happen. What makes it possible for a totalitarian or any other dictatorship to rule is that people are not informed; how can you have an opinion if you are not informed? <strong>If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer.</strong> (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider for a moment why the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution restricts the U.S. Government from preventing a free press and from instituting a national religion. National religions and state run press were two tools of tyranny during the 17th and 18th centuries and why the founders felt important to retrict the U.S. Government access to those tools. Unfortunately, I think the far right has found a loophole to the process.</p>

The Republicans will do everything and say everything to make sure Trump is not to blame. Only one Republican, Mitt Romney, appears willing to do what is right for the country rather than what is only right for themselves.</p>

<p>Also, note, the problem here isn&rsquo;t really with Trump, it&rsquo;s with the people in the Republican party who enabled Trump to win their primary and be elected. Unless Republicans, starting with Republican Senators, start to publicly stand up against Trump and LEAD, they should all be held accountable. It&rsquo;s time for Republicans to decided whether or not they are true Americans and true patriots. I so wish John McCain were still alive!</p>

<p>“In one study, Dominic Abrams and his colleagues divided groups of participants into smaller groups based on trivial categories (e.g., groups based on numbers that were randomly assigned to them). Then participants were asked to complete a difficult perceptual task while receiving helpful information from members of either their ingroup or outgroup. <strong>They found that participants did not rely on input from outgroup members even when it would have been useful for them to do so. Instead, they toiled on alone. Abrams and colleagues wrote, “[ Participants] resisted information purely on the basis that it was derived from a category of person to which they did not belong.””</strong> (Emphasis added)</p>

         	<p>“You don’t have to have scriptural or religious teaching. It’s just the truth: You can’t survive on your own. If you say you are going to be totally selfish, in next to no time the person who is totally selfish goes under. You need other people in order to be human. That’s why when they want to punish you they put you in solitary confinement. Because you can’t flourish without other human beings. They give you things that you cannot give yourself, no matter how much money you have. And so we speak of Ubuntu. A person is a person through other persons. And there must have been some people who said, ‘Ah, what a primitive way of thinking.’ It’s the most fundamental law of our being. We flout that—we flout it at our peril.”</p>

<p>Trump also told his audience, “I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing.” The Insurance Industry quickly announced it had only agreed to cover testing, not treatment, for the coronavirus</p>

<p>On the surface, Roam looks like a cross between a slightly weird wiki and a note-taking tool like Evernote. It’s not. It implements a few key features of 1980s vintage hypertext visions — block-level addressability, transclusion (changes in referenced blocks being “transfer-included” wherever they are cited), and bidirectional linking — that utterly transform the writing experience at the finger-tips level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Roam for a while and have pretty much transferred all of my private information gathering and knowledge processing into it from Tiddlywiki. The description above is the best I&rsquo;ve seen yet of why I like Roam.</p>

         	<p>There is a big gap in <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html#a183828">how the POTUS should be hired/elected</a> and how he or she is actually elected. One of the first questions I ask myself when determining who to vote for is whether the candidates are competent for the job. What qualifications do they have? Are they capable. In 2016 there was no doubt that Trump was not competent to be POTUS and that immediately disqualified him for the job, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Our country would be much better, I think, if all citizens first considered what are the skills for the job of POTUS and not what that person can do for them. Ultimately the skill is leadership, and leadership requires listening, compromise, persuasion, and humility.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The French horn’s register plays in a higher range of the harmonic series (essentially, the notes that are naturally playable without the use of valves), compared to other brass instruments. At higher pitches, it is incredibly sensitive to even small changes in the position of the mouth and air volume. That’s one of the main causes of so many blunders, and the reason brass players joke that the best way to make a trombone sound like a French horn is to stuff your hand into the bell and miss all your notes.</p>

         	<p>The main issue I have with the Democrat primary is that the candidate that I prefer is probably not the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, and I think removing Trump from office is the prime objective. Yet, the candidate that I prefer has a better chance of beating Trump than other candidates. Worse, I do not think Sanders is one of the candidates with the best chance of beating Trump. Still, the big question is whether all Democrats will unite behind whoever is the candidate. While Clinton did not campaign well enough to win in 2016, she was also hurt by Sanders supporters who refused to vote for her and that cannot happen this time or Trump wins re-election.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia’s influence campaign is driven by a desire to “watch us tear ourselves apart,” a senior FBI official said Monday, comments that come after details of a classified briefing to lawmakers became public in news reports, including a claim by the intelligence community’s top election security official that Moscow is interfering with the goal of helping President Donald Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely Russia learned how easy it has become to do this from our actions post 9-11. I think part of the problem is including that lede &ldquo;with the goal of helping President Donald Trump.&rdquo; Perhaps that is true, but the true goal is decreasing United States&rsquo; standing in the world and elevating Putin&rsquo;s Russia, and that alone should be concerning to Trump and his supporters as much as everyone else. Republican refusal to do anything is pure negligence.</p>

Consequently, there is no agreement about what&rsquo;s most important. Republicans are obsessed with keeping the guy with the R next to his name in the White House even if they don&rsquo;t like him. In their mind any Democrat will do more damage than Trump and anyone raising concerns about Trump are just partisan.</p>

<p>Democrats are NOT united on the priority to remove Trump, rather there appears to be a faction that seems to say, &ldquo;if extreme is the new norm then we have to nominate the most extreme person to win.&rdquo; It appears most Democrats have lost regard for moderates and independents. It&rsquo;s as if they learned the wrong lessons from 2016.</p>

<p>We really need a viable third party candidate; if only the current system wasn&rsquo;t rigged against that happening. Neither party seems really invested in the Constitution, and if you don&rsquo;t recognize Trump as a threat to the Constitution then you conclude he is no different than any other candidate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A weblog is a hierarchy of text, images, media objects and data, arranged chronologically, that can be viewed in an HTML browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will find many details about the components that make up a weblog, but to me the keys are chronology, usually reverse meaning most recent at the top of the page, voice, generally meaning written by a person, and brevity. The last is not something many consider but I think that good weblog posts are no more than three paragraphs long and I think there is a difference between an essay or a story and a weblog post. A story always has a title, a weblog post may or may not not have a title, and in fact most posts do not have a title.</p>

<p>What became confusing is when people and companies used weblog platforms as content management platforms to create and maintain web sites of an form and fashion and thus if a site were published by Wordpress it automatically was called a blog.</p>

<p>W. E. B.

<p>Personal computing tablet style is mobile. Tablets are smaller, lighter and have longer battery life than notebook computers, and they are designed to be typed on via an on-screen keyboard from almost any position, while a notebook is designed to be typed on while placed on a flat surface.</p>

<p>It is my belief that Steve Jobs views the iPad as an implementation of the iPhone Way to personal computing, and because that the iPhone Way is completely opposite to how we have always thought of personal computing, there are a lot of negative reviews of the iPad. You see arguments like “the iPad does not multitask (run mulitiple programs at the same time) so it is not a real computer,” or “the iPad does not have any USB ports to plug in hardware peripherals, so it is not a real computer.” I think both of these intentional design limitations were made to make the iPad simpler to use, because, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1529133/iworry-does-ipad-signal-end-era-open-computing?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+fastcompany/headlines+(Fast+Company+Headlines)">who is to say that our definition of personal computing today will be the same definition ten years from now</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the Apple iPad announcement. Back on January 27, 2010 I wrote, &ldquo;<a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/27/has-apple-made-tablets-legit/">Has Apple Made Tablets Legit</a>?&rdquo; and the answer ten years later is a resounding yes. Personally, my iPads are my most used and most important personal computer. Ten years ago the iPad was limited enough to be viewed as a device one uses to read or watch videos, but the current iPads and now iPadOS paired with a keyboard and mouse make it capable of most forms of personal computing. There will always be situations and people demand nothing but a full notebook computer, and that is fine, as Steve Jobs said back then, one can still drive a truck. Happy belated birthday iPad!</p>

<p>P.S. Reading my <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/29/drinking-from-the-ipad-firehose/">past writing</a> on this <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/30/the-iphone-way/">topic</a>, I realize that embedded in the iPad was Apple&rsquo;s transition to designing their own processors, with their first included in that iPad.</p>

<p>P.S.S. I find it really cool that I can look back and read what I wrote ten years ago. Of course, that only happens because I am paying the bill to continue hosting my old blog. This December I will have been blogging for 21 years.</p>

         	<p>Last week I participated in <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2020/01/20/mobileviews-podcast-314-guests-frank-mcpherson-chris-spera/">the MobileViews podcast</a> and in it we talked about foldable screen devices. I stated my opinion that we ought to think of them as foldable tablets rather than foldable phones. In other words, are there use cases in which we wish we could use a tablet but it&rsquo;s too large to carry around? I think this is important positioning because most people are going to think smartphones are small enough, and foldables are really about making a large screen surface smaller. Coincidentally Microsoft released their SDK for Duo, which is there planned foldable smartphone that they announced last October. The Verge has taken a look at the SDK and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/23/21077846/microsoft-software-sdk-duo-android-phone-pragmatism">explained how that translates to the user experience</a> and I agree it sounds like Microsoft has the right approach. I do wonder, though, about how many cases where users wish they could see Android apps side by side because that appears to be one of the cases Duo will be well suited.</p>

         	<p>The New York Times has <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/01/20/152047.html?title=iStillLikeKlobuchar#a152218">a strong statement</a> about Bernie Sanders, which I see as a bug, not a feature. The bug was introduced to the U.S. government by Ronald Reagan. The bug is thinking that compromise and changing one&rsquo;s mind is wrong. Reality is that compromise and changing one&rsquo;s mind is wisdom, which we sorely lack. The root cause of the bug is thinking of the President of the United States as a dictator. You see this clearly in Trump&rsquo;s actions and in his words: &ldquo;Only I can do it.!&rdquo; In the Republic formed by the United States Constitution governing involves compromise and convincing people to change their minds. By design one person can NOT change our government. It&rsquo;s on purpose, and I do not think one can claim themselves a patroit of the United States without embracing this understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My observation of the managers I work for is that when they talk about &ldquo;growth&rdquo; they mean financial (revenue and profit) growth, not at all what is described in this article. Perhaps that is a difference between managers and leaders?</p>

<p>I hired in to a company that believed this and had the culture to back it. Over time as leaders left and MBAs took over creating the best engineers was deemed too expensive and with that the culture deteriorated to the point where today it is worse than non existent. Corporate America lots of managers making lots of money running corporations and very few true leaders.</p>

<p>For me the money quote is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When speaking to engineer leaders we bring up the story about the Netflix engineer above. We do this to emphasize the importance of the environment they are creating. “Creating,” being the operative word here. Environments don’t just happen, they are created through action.</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s inability to do so is the prime reason why he should have never been elected nor should be re-elected. It&rsquo;s simple really, either we live under the rule of law established by the Constitution, meaning we have a republic, or we don&rsquo;t meaning we have a dictatorship.</p>

For me this is the primary reason why Trump should be convicted by the Senate, he simply does not care about the Constitution and that alone is the highest violation of his oath and is abuse of power. We should NOT have Presidents who refuse to acknowledge they are <strong>constrained</strong> by the Constitution, which frankly is the <strong>fundamental tenant of conservatism.</strong></p>

<p>Remember when new phones were announced at CES? Hard to believe this was 11 years ago. Reading the article, I think it was a good analysis on my part. The functionality of Synergy has in most ways been integrated into iOS and Android, but ironically the wireless charging that Touchstone had is still not pervasive. My bottom line proved correct, Palm could not get developers to write apps, they were already occupied with iOS and Android. Palm would flounder until being eventually bought by my then employer, Hewlett Packard.</p>

<p>I stand by my opinion that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">WebOS</a> is the best tablet operating system that I have ever used. If you think of it, ChromeOS is in many ways an iteration of WebOS except that it was keyboard first and thus still struggling in a tablet format.</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/01/07/configuring-a-raspberry.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-01-07 22:25:00 -0400">Jan 7, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2019/11/24/mobileviews-podcast-308-raspberry-pi-as-an-ipad-accessory-macbook-pro-thoughts-and-more/">episode 308</a> of the MobileViews podcast Jon Westfall talked about <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/">a blog post</a> describing how to configure a Raspberry Pi 4 as a USB-C accessory for the iPad Pro. The instructions configure the Pi so that you connect an iPad to the Pi using a USB-C cable. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6sDcKo3V8">A video</a> is also available that provides step-by-step instructions, and you can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSlyqo5Q2Q">another video</a> in which the author answers questions that were left in the comments of the original video.</p>

<p>While I found the concept intriguing there is no way I could implement it because it only works if you have the latest iPad Pro that has a USB-C port, which I do not have.</p>

<p>Later I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbvSS8MJm2s">another video</a> done by the author of the original one showing how to install an application called <a href="https://raspap.com/">RaspAP</a> and configure it to be a WiFi hotspot AND a WiFi client at the same time. With this configuration you can connect any iPad, or any other device that has WiFi and then you can SSH in to the Pi from the iPad to have access to a Linux command prompt, from which you could run a number of different applications, programming environments, and utilities.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually not too difficult to configure a Raspberry Pi as a WiFi hotspot (access point) and I actually had done so to a small Raspberry Pi Zero W that I have been using as a portable backup for a wiki I maintain of home information. The problem with how I have been using the Pi Zero is that it can only be either a WiFi access point OR a WiFi client, so when configured as an access point the Pi Zero can&rsquo;t connect to my home network or the Internet.</p>

<p>What makes RaspAP better is that it configures a Raspberry Pi so that it can be an access point AND WiFi client at the same time using the same wlan port! I am not sure how this is done because as you may know a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; WiFi access point must have a second wired Ethernet connection to connect to a cable modem and provide Internet access, in such instances the access point routes (or bridges) network traffic between two networks (different IP addressing), one being the WiFi network and the other being the wired network, each requiring one port.</p>

<p>The installation of RaspAP does require connecting the Raspberry Pi to a wired network connection because there is a step that requires resetting the wlan0 interface that will hang if the port is in use. However, after installation, the Pi will connect to your home network and act as an access point for another network at the same time.</p>

<p>Along the way I also found out that I can power the Raspberry Pi 3b+ using the Ravpower  (Model RP-PB043) portable battery that I own, which means that I have a portable, wireless network between an iPad and and a Linux computer that will work anywhere.</p>

<p>How might I use this set up?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I am working on a Nodejs program. I can have Nodejs installed on the Raspberry Pi and I can have all my code also on that Pi, perhaps cloned from a git repo. Let&rsquo;s say I plan to be on a long flight and I want to carry a minimal amount of gear. I can pack my iPad Pro, Raspberry Pi, and the Ravpower in my carry on and when I am able, power up the Pi, leave it in the carry on, and connect to it via WiFi from the iPad. At this point I can then SSH into the Pi and use a text editor (emacs, nano, etc..) to work on my code and test it using nodejs. Of course, you can do this for any other programming environments or compilers that install on the Raspberry Pi and run via the command prompt. (Actually.. one should also be able to VNC into the graphical Raspbarian environment if you need to.)</p>

<p>While I could do the above via the airplane WiFi, doing so costs money and service can be spotty, this network connectivity once configured is available nearly the same way all the time. The &ldquo;remote programmer&rdquo; scenario is just one idea off the top of my head, I am sure there are other uses cases for a configuration such as this. The developer of RaspAP is working to include OpenVPN to make the Pi a VPN endpoint that will provide all secured network communication for all devices that connect to it. You can find more examples for using RaspAP <a href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-awesome">in this Github repo</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If the President has been willing to withhold foreign military assistance to secure campaign help, how could Americans trust him when he launched a military strike against another country? Was Solemani&rsquo;s killing done in the national interest or in Trump&rsquo;s self-interest? Did the President create serious instability for his own needs, possibly even in an effort to divert public attention from the impeachment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Trump lies and this is not even disputed by most of his supporters, they just claim he is no different than Obama or any other past president. So, given that we all accept that he lies, how can we trust anything he or his administration says? If we are to go back in to war again, should we not be sure it&rsquo;s for legitimate reasons? If you are a patriot and support our military who puts their life on the line then you should demand the risk of their sacrifice is in support of the interests of the United States and not just the President of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even as the U.S. economy hums along at a favorable pace, there is a vast segment of workers today earning wages low enough to leave their livelihood and families extremely vulnerable.

</blockquote>

<p>The current economy is not about employment and it&rsquo;s certainly not about the stock market, it&rsquo;s about wages. Employers do not want to increase wages or provide full time employment.</p>

<p>Candidates for POTUS need to properly identify the problem, talk about whether the current course we are on, which seems targeted at tariffs, is really going to solve the problem, and if not propose solutions.</p>

<p>This is a great story about the Atari personal computers. I bought an Atari 800XL when I was in college and used it along with a VT-100 terminal emulator to write programs for my computer science classes in the late 80s. (Back then most of our programming was done on mainframes and we only really needed a terminal.) After being hired out of college I &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; to an Atari 1040ST, which had a GUI similar to the Mac but cost much less. I will always think fondly of Atari due to its role in my early personal computer days.</p>

         	<p>I have found <a href="https://micropublish.net/about">Micropublish</a> that suggests it could be used to edit posts given its URL but when I tried to use it to edit the prior post it generated an internal server error. An Implementation Status table on <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">the Indieweb Micropub clients page</a> suggests the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is that micro.blog does not support/expose the delete, undelete, or update actions; the only action it appears you can do from a Micropub client is create.</p>

<p>I notice that OmniBear hasn&rsquo;t been updated in more than a year so I might start using Micropublish more, it is even possible to self host the app.</p>

         	<p>Today <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html">Dave Winer writes</a> about simplicity of blogging, what he describes as Flow. The idea is to make writing a new blog post as frictionless as possible.</p>

<p>For me it very quick to write and publish a new blog post, I click the <a href="https://omnibear.com/">OmniBear</a> icon on the Chrome toolbar, write in Content field, and click Post. Boom, I have a new post on my blog.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html#a154653">what happens next</a> is a problem. To edit a post I have to go to the micro.blog site and click through many steps rather than see a simple Edit link on the post or the ability to open the post to edit in Bear.</p>

<p>Editing appears to be a weakness of <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">micropub</a>, most likely because its origin is tied to Twitter which has no concept of editing. We need better ways to originate and edit blog posts.</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/12/18/comcast-data-cap.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-18 12:23:31 -0400">Dec 18, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/plans/">Comcast&rsquo;s 1024 GB (1 TB) monthly data plan</a> (data cap) does not provide enough data for an increasing number of people. The main reason is that an increasing number of services, like Netflix, are streaming video at 4K quality, and in the case of Netflix, it default is to stream at the highest quality. Comcast and I fundamentally disagree, in that <a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/">Comcast says few people will actually be affected</a> by the data cap.</p>

<p>Last week I was shocked when I received an email notice from Comcast that we had consumed 90% of our 1024 data for the month. Why does Comcast default the notification to 90% rather than 50%? The higher data consumption appears to coincide with an automatic and &ldquo;free&rdquo; increase of our bandwidth to 100 Mbps last month. Comcast says an increase in bandwidth does not automatically lead to increase data usage, but given that Netflix, and I assume other apps, default to the highest quality video I suspect we ended up viewing more 4K video this month than we have in the past.</p>

<p>Ever since receiving the email notification I have been closely monitoring our data usage, comparing network traffic stats to Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter, and I think the usage meter is accurate, unlike an issue that occurred in October where the meter was wrongly indicating drastically higher consumption. In general, I think Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter is insufficient in that it only shows a monthly total. If you have a cap and will automatically charge overages, I think you must at least provide daily stats. The worst part is that home owners don&rsquo;t have a good or easy to use tools of their own to confirm Comcast&rsquo;s data, leaving consumers at a disadvantage when trying to dispute Comcast&rsquo;s data.</p>

<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/estimator/">Comcast&rsquo;s Usage Estimate calculator</a> says a HD stream consumes 1.7 GB of data per hour, where as Netflix says that 1 hour of HD consumes 3 GB. Comcast and Netflix agree that one hour of 4K video consumes around 8 GB per hour. Using Netflix&rsquo;s rate that HD consumes 3 GB per hour, Comcast&rsquo;s claim that you can stream 21 GB per day of HD video is not correct. At 3 GB per hour, that&rsquo;s 11 hours per day for 1024 GB per month.</p>

<p>Last night I watched 1 hour of CW Seed on my Apple TV that consumed 6 GB of data, suggesting to me that stream is UHD quality rather than HD and I don&rsquo;t see a way to control the quality in the CW Seed app.</p>

<p>If you only have one video stream in a house, 11 hours is probably enough, but if you increase that to two streams, you are down to 5 hours per day per stream and that is not hard to exceed, particularly if you unknowingly watch some video in 4K. If you stream all video at 4K you can only watch a little over 4 hours per day, which is tight for one stream, and impossible for two.</p>

<p>You can control the quality of the video streams for some services, but you have to do so per application/service. For example, you can <a href="https://ipstarbroadband.com.au/support/how-to-reduce-netflix-data-usage/">configure Netflix to only stream at Standard quality</a>, but who wants to do that if they spent money on a HD TV? And, if you use more than one app, as many do with say Disney+ or Amazon Prime, you might not be able to change the video quality or you will have to spend a lot of time changing settings in indivdiual apps. And again&hellip; you spent good money on a high quality TV, you rightly expect to be able to see the best video!</p>

<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/unlimited/">Comcast does provide an unlimited plan</a> for an additional $50 per month. The current cap appears intended to drive more, if not most, home owners to pay that $50 more per month. (I personally don&rsquo;t do online gaming, but I bet that can consume a significant amount of data per month). In my case, Comcast kindly increased our bandwidth to 100 Mbps at no additional cost&hellip;. but that&rsquo;s not entirely true since I now appear to be in the position of having to pay $50 more per month!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I continue to monitor <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/internet-data-consumption">my home Internet data usage</a> closely since receiving notice from Comcast that we are near the 1024 GB monthly cap. I enabled Traffic Stats on my home router so that I can compare that to Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter. Traffic stats is an approximation because it doesn&rsquo;t only show traffic coming in from the Internet but also traffic within my home network, but I think it can give me an indication of whether Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter is accurate. (If caps are going to be a thing, Home Routers need a feature that shows download and upload traffic to the Internet.)</p>

<p>After the first day, it seems the Comcast usage meter is accurate. If that is true, somehow we doubled our Internet data usage and the only thing I know changed is that our bandwidth jumped to 100 Mbps in the last month. The usage meter only shows data going back to June, so it looks to me like Comcast just started enforcing this data cap in our area, probably coinciding with the increase to 100 Mbps. Something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, my usage as around 775 GB per month and with no other change other than the bandwidth increase I don&rsquo;t know what we have been doing differently. It&rsquo;s as if Netflix detected I have more bandwidth and decided on its own to use it and I don&rsquo;t see an option to throttle it back to 1080 or 720.</p>

<p>The data cap is annoying, and frankly I think the lack in detail in Comcast&rsquo;s reporting is a problem that needs to be addressed by regulation. If you have a cap you can&rsquo;t just report a monthly total, I think you have to at least show daily usage. Given that increase in streaming providers supporting 4K video, 1024 GB (1 TB) per month is really not enough.</p>

<p>Comcast will be happy to remove the cap if I pay them $50 more per month. I will probably end up paying that for the benefit of not needing to constantly monitor data usage.</p>

We ought to have substantive conversation about what is America and how it might be great, but we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Here is a problem, greatness is not something one can self-declare. My constantly saying that I am great does not make me so, that makes me arrogant. Greatness is only determined by people other than oneself, and the same is true for countries. This is something Americans don&rsquo;t seem to understand, but it is a truth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think most people add the words &ldquo;for me&rdquo; to the end of MAGA, which ironically is the exact opposite to <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/documents/ask-not.htm">a quote from a Democrat President, John F. Kennedy</a>. A quote that frankly conservatives should recognize as their own rather than a liberal&rsquo;s. Please think about that when you complain about entitlement.</p>

<p>We ought to aspire to greatness, but that aspiration needs to be framed in the understanding of how greatness is truly determined.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I received an email from Comcast informing me that we have consumed 90% of our 1 TB data alotment for the month. While I had been vaguely aware that <a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/faq/">Comcast has data caps</a>, I had not encountered an issue with it until today.</p>

<p>What I find odd is that we have been averaging about 650 GB of data per month, and now mid-month Comcast is saying we have already consumed about 900 GB? What changed? Frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I noticed that mid last month our Internet download speed increased from around 70 mbps to 100 mbps. There seems to be a relationship between the increase in our bandwidth and how much Comcast claims we are now using. I didn&rsquo;t ask for the bandwidth increase. I am wondering whether now that our speed is faster the streaming services we use have flipped over to higher data rate video streaming than we&rsquo;ve been using previously?</p>

<p>What is frustrating is that the data usage meter Comcast provides is just a total consumption per month, it doesn&rsquo;t show me a per day or even per week breakdown. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know how I have any way to confirm that what Comcast is claiming I am consuming is what I am actually using!</p>

<p>Comcast provides 2 months of &ldquo;free&rdquo; data overage before they will start charging me $10 for each 50 GB we go over the cap per month, so I don&rsquo;t have to do anything drastic right now. Right now I don&rsquo;t even know how to begin to fight this thing, I am going to have to study the topic and see if there is something that I can implement on my end to show how much data we actually do consume per month.</p>

         	<p>I needed to buy a new smartphone this week that I did not want to spend much money on because I really just needed it to handle phone calls and text messages, so I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV/">this Nokia 6</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my first phone from the new Nokia and I have to say that I am really impressed. Solid construction with a very nice display. Best of all so far is the Battery life&hellip; it&rsquo;s been running for more than 30 hours since I charged it and still has 40% left&hellip; although I don&rsquo;t have many apps (particularly apps like Facebook) installed, so that may be a contributor.</p>

<p>A bonus with this phone is that it is dual SIM, unlocked and it can also use a SD card, although if you do you cannot use the second SIM as it uses the same slot.</p>

<p>While the phone ships with Android 7.1.1. installed it upgraded to Android 9 immediately upon set up. It is stock Android with only an FM Radio and My Phone apps added to the standard apps you find with Android.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this phone will upgrade to Android 10 and Google may not be pushing security updates for Androids 9, but I have found this to be a great phone for the price!</p>

         	<p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/12/11/does-not-look.html">Earlier this week</a> we learned that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chat</a> was generally available to Android users, and at the time it did not look to me like it was working with AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>As it happened, I set up a new phone on AT&amp;T this week and I was surprised to find that when I started Messages I saw a message saying Chat messaging was available. I then went in to Google Play and saw that the Carrier Services app was installed on the phone.</p>

<p>I still didn&rsquo;t see the feature available on my Pixel 2, however, so I thought, what if I searched for Carrier Services in Google Play and tried to install it? Turns out that I found it and was able to install it and after that the Chat services connected and was functional.</p>

<p>I now have two phones with the feature enabled, which allows me to test it. You will know if you are using chat if you see &ldquo;Chat message&rdquo; displayed in the input box, otherwise you see &ldquo;Text message&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I find the chat functions similar to Facebook Messenger. If you are chatting back and forth you see the &hellip; indicating a response is being typed. The messages and pictures appear near instantly.</p>

<p>BTW, the two phones I have are on Android 10 and 9, so I know at least one generation older than the current will be able to use the service. I am looking forward to seeing whether/how soon my friends get the service.</p>

         	<p>Today electing a president is not about issues, nor is it about changing minds, nor is it about who looks better and sounds better of TV. The election is not about a personal popularity contest. Electing a president is now simply about opposition. In short, there is no middle ground just as the middle class has grown increasingly small.</p>

<p>If you identify Republican you are likely going to only vote for Republicans because you think all Democrats are crazy and will destroy the country. Likewise, if you identify Democrat you will only vote Democrat. If you really don&rsquo;t like your candidate you will not vote, or write in Mickey Mouse rather than cast a vote for the opposing party.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the candidates only say what their &ldquo;base&rdquo; wants to  hear, and it doesn&rsquo;t even matter of what is said is true. Candidates don&rsquo;t really try to change people&rsquo;s minds. In this environment, do we really need debates?  Worse, there is little for few remaing, truly &ldquo;independent&rdquo; voters to hear, and frankly doing a bunch of research is too much work for the average voter. Increasing numbers of these disenfranchised voters will simply sit out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think Democrats think the lesson learned from 2016 is to focus on their base and ignore the middle because they think there are more liberal/progressives voters than conservative, Republicans, or independents. An extreme shift left is viewed by their opposition as further evidence of crazy Democrats.</p>

<p>The authors of the U.S. Constitution foresaw this type of fanaticism that democracy enables and thus created a structure to prevent it. Unfortunately, over time political idealogies have trumped preservation of the Republic concentrating more power within the Presidency. A party aligned, rubber stamping Congress and Supreme Court is a defacto dictatorship and this is effectly today&rsquo;s U.S. government.</p>

<p>Actually, I am looking forward to seeing how well the Call Screening &ldquo;feature&rdquo; works. Right now I have Do Not Disturb enabled to only allows calls from phone numbers in my contacts.

         	<p>Upon further review it looks like my Pixel 2 doesn&rsquo;t know how to display the signal strength when the phone connects to the AT&amp;T Microcell in our home. When I leave the house it displays fine, but when I come back and it connects to the Microcell I actually see it show all bars and then the bars disappear. Perhaps it&rsquo;s due to the fact that the microcell only provides 3G data, which I don&rsquo;t care about because I use WiFi for data at home. In the the number of bars don&rsquo;t really matter so long as my call connections work and don&rsquo;t drop, but it&rsquo;s annoying.</p>

         	<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t understand is why people don&rsquo;t get that Bernie Sanders is not a Democrat. When he is not running for President Bernie has an I by his name, and frankly I see him as using the party. It is fair to say Bernie is a Progressive, but that does not necessarily make him a Democrat. If people thought about it, they would also realize that a person who considers themself a Conservative does not necessarily mean they are a Republican, nor should one assume that a person calls themself a Republican that means they are a Conservative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They offer us something much better, an entirely different way of knowing: an intimate relationship, a dark journey, a path where we must discover for ourselves that grace, love, mercy, and forgiveness are absolutely necessary for survival in an uncertain world. You only need enough clarity to know how to live without certitude! Yes, we really are saved by faith. People who live in this way never stop growing, are not easily defeated, are wise and compassionate, and frankly, are fun to live with. They have a quiet and confident joy. Infantile religion insists on certainty every step of the way and thus is not very happy.</p>

<p>A nice thing about Chrome OS is that it enables to to work with folders in Google Drive as if they are locally on your computer.

         	<p>While listening to <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2019/11/24/mobileviews-podcast-308-raspberry-pi-as-an-ipad-accessory-macbook-pro-thoughts-and-more/">the latest MobileViews Podcast</a> I heard Jon Westfall describe using the Raspberry Pi 4 as an accessory to an iPad Pro. The key component of the solution is the USB-C ports on the iPad Pro and the Raspberry Pi 4 because they are used to power the Raspberry Pi and provide network communication between the iPad and the Raspberry Pi. I am surprised that the iPad&rsquo;s USB-C power output meets the Pi 4&rsquo;s higher power input requirements, however I learned that the latest firmware upgrade for the Pi 4 includes a low power option along with Ethernet over USB, which are  key for this working.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://youtu.be/IR6sDcKo3V8">a YouTube video</a> that shows the configuration and a link to <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/">a web page</a> that provides more details about the configuration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Raspberry Pi Zero W in a similar manner except that I power it using USB battery and access it via WiFi when the Pi Zero is configured as a wireless access point. The result provides me access to Linux terminal apps but does not provide simultaneous access to the Internet.</p>

<p>I like the idea of using the Raspberry Pi 4 as described, but in my case I would need to buy a new iPad Pro with the USB-C port. Capabilities such of this do make the idea of upgrading to the latest iPad Pros more compelling.</p>

         	<p>I bought <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/raspberry-pi-4">the Raspberry Pi4</a> this past week and I&rsquo;ve installed it in a <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">Flirc Raspberry Pi4</a> case. Beside the fact that the Flirc case looks really nice, the case provides passive cooling of the CPU. Reviews of the Pi4 when it first released indicated it ran hot enough under load to hit the 82&rsquo;C threshold that causes the CPU speed to throttle down. The Raspberry Pi Foundation as released a firmware update that improves cooling and so far with the firmware and the Flirc case the top temp I&rsquo;ve seen is 44&rsquo;C.</p>

<p>The reason why the Raspberry Pi4 runs hotter is that it has a faster ARM Cortex-A72 CPU processor, as much as 4 GB of RAM, and a USB-C power supply. I am using daenerys (my name for this computer) to type this post and I am finding it surprisingly useful for web applications. Gmail, with its heavy use of Javascript is unbearable in older models, but is actually usable on the Pi4.</p>

<p>For a little under $100, the Pi4 is defintely worth being a child&rsquo;s first computer. I think it can also be a very servicable Linux server, running Raspbian Buster Lite, a variant of Debian Buster, for home projects.</p>

<p>Right now I don&rsquo;t any plans for daenerys but I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes open for any opportunities. Daenerys is my fifth Raspberry Pi. The first model I bought was the Pi2, which I have connected to a seven inch screen and serves a desk clock that shows my schedule, CNN newsfeed, current weather, and four day weather forcase. I have a Pi3 running Tiddlyserver that I am using to for a family wiki, and another running Taiga, which is a project management app. I also have a Pi Zero W that use to host a portable copy of the family wiki.</p>

         	<p>“In the 1700s, philosophers like John Locke argued that public life and politics should be separated from gratitude. Civic relations should be based on rules and laws—not gifts, favors, or quid pro quo—with the participation and consent of the governed. Private life, philosophers suggested, could still be ordered by gifts and gratitude in the more limited arenas of families and friends. <strong>Thus, constitutions eventually replaced kingly rulers, and laws distributed political benefits through the will of the people.</strong>”  (emphasis mine)</p>

         	<p>“The emperor or king gave his subjects the “gifts” of protection and provision. In return, subjects offered loyalty, homage, service, tithes, and taxes. If you failed to return the ruler’s favor—such as not paying a tribute or refusing to send your son to serve in the army—you were branded an “ingrate.” Ingratitude was disloyalty and sometimes treason, crimes punishable by denial of favor, reduction in rank, seizure of property, enslavement, prison, exile, or death.”</p>

         	<p>President Trump simply believes that he as president cannot commit a crime. He believes that a president is above the law. Trump&rsquo;s belief is the logical conclusion of decades of expansion of presidential powers that started with Vietnam.</p>

<p>How far have we fallen? At the beginning of my life President Nixon resigned before he was impeached because he broke the law. Nixon knew he would be impeached because he knew and accepted that Americans did not believe a President was above the law. We now have President Trump who believes that more Americans now accept that a President is above the law and believes that Americans today find loyalty to him and loyalty to party more important than loyalty to the Republic.</p>

<p>All presidents in my life time have desired more power. The real problem has been Congress&rsquo; abdication of it&rsquo;s prime constitutional responsibility to be a check on the presidency. At root of this abdication is the transformation of Congress as representative of all U.S. citizens to only representative of the majority party. Rather than upholding and defending the U.S. Constitution, Congress has become all about enabling and implementing a Republican or Democrat ideology.</p>

<p>What I find ironic is that I think the core belief of conservatism is that &ldquo;abosolute power corrupts absolutely&rdquo; and yet Republican conservatives have been the prime architects of the expansion of powers to the president. Conservatives should be truly republican but do not act like it, but rather tend to act more as anarchists.</p>

<p>Worst of all is that too many U.S. citizens do not care that this is happening! Too many people do not know the Constitution nor appreciate the fundamental reasons for why the U.S. form of republican democracy was designed and adopted. These people pledge allegiance to a flag <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/no-brainer-trump-tweets-support-for-amendment-banning-flag-burning-1.586168">as if the flag is the thing</a> rather than a symbol of the real thing, our way of life enabled by the Constitution.</p>

<p>What has been taking place over the course of my life time is the ascendency of a U.S. monarchy or dictatorship under the veneer of the Presidency. If you are truly a U.S. patriot your loyalty should be to the &ldquo;Republic for which it stands&rdquo;, which means the Constitution that defines the republic.</p>

<p>The emoluments clause, also called the foreign emoluments clause, is a provision of the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 8) that generally prohibits federal officeholders from receiving any gift, payment, or other thing of value from a foreign state or its rulers, officers, or representatives.</p>

<p>The plain purpose of the foreign emoluments clause was to ensure that the country’s leaders would not be improperly influenced, even unconsciously, through gift giving, then a common and generally corrupt practice among European rulers and diplomats.</p>

         	<p>“The worst cost of factions comes when they capture the state for rent-seeking—for the purpose of directing the state’s power for the benefit of themselves, and for the exploitation and even the oppression of others. But because this problem is “sown” in human nature, which is permanent, so, too, is the problem. Hence there can be no end—no conceivable end—to the need to limit government by circumscribing its powers that can be captured by factions. This is true even—actually, especially—when the power of the state is wielded in response to a majority faction.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been the general American practice regarding criminal law to grant considerable discretion to prosecutors, so that by analogy one could argue that the House has complete discretion to decide whether to initiate impeachment proceedings. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist No. 77, argued that the nation would find &ldquo;republican&rdquo; safety from a presidential abuse of power by the mode of his election and by his &ldquo;being at all times liable to impeachment.&rdquo; There is no doubt that the Framers saw impeachment as a part of the system of checks and balances to maintain the separation of powers and the republican form of government. <strong>The implication is that when the President (or other impeachable official) has committed an impeachable offense, the Members of the House, bound by the oaths they take to uphold the Constitution, are under a particular obligation to deal with the miscreant&rsquo;s offenses, irrespective of whether their bill of impeachment may or may not lead to a conviction in the Senate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely, this is why a Republican-led House initiated impeachment proceedings on Bill Clinton. Why should the current Democrat-led House not be bound to the same obligation to hold proceedings on President Trump.</p>

         	<p>One thing I found interesting in Microsoft&rsquo;s announcements yesterday is the starting price for the Surface Pro 7 at $749, lower than other Surface Pros that I can remember. My guess is that model will have low end specs, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/02/surface-pro-7-vs-the-pro-6/">Engadet shows</a> are an Intel Core i3, 4 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage.

         	<p>I watched <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/microsoftevent">the 2019 Microsoft Surface event</a> and I have to admit that I like what I saw of the Surface Neo and Duo. Microsoft has basically taken the concept of using two desktop computer monitors to a mobile device, the question is whether that works with large or small screens. I also wonder about their durability, but we have had foldback screens on notebook PCs for a long time now, so that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>

<p>I also think <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview">the Surface Pro X</a> looks very nice, I can see it as a decent competitor to the iPad Pro, but the $999 starting price is too high. My reaction first reaction to it is that it looks like what the Google Pixel Slate should have been.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that despite Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud first/mobile first strategy, they are developing some really nice looking hardware.</p>

         	<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel">achilles&rsquo; heel</a> of the U.S. Constitution are political parties. The model of government the U.S. Constitution established was designed to forge a republic of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; from southern and northern states, within the context of slavery. The Constitution was not written to address and mitigate the power of political parties and thus I see the possibility of a constitutionally enabled dictatorship.</p>

<p>How would a constitutionally enabled dictatorship look like? First, you neuter the electoral college. Next, you remove all power from the minority party in Congress. Next, you have 60% of the U.S. Senate made up of party of the President and more than half of the House also the same party as the President. Finally, you have all Supreme Court justices of the same party as the president. All three branches align to one party and then Congress and the Supreme Court do nothing more than rubber stamp anything the President requests and you have in place a dictatorship.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is not supposed to be political but it now totally is ever since the Reagan administration.</p>

<p>The Congress is supposed to be the primary means of checks and balances but that too has turned into nothing more than alignment with the President since Vietnam.</p>

<p>The fourth estate, the press, is now corporately owned and no longer fulfills its defacto role in government given to it by the first amendment.</p>

<p>And finally, we seem to no longer really have U.S. Citizens, instead we are people who see themselves as Conservative or Liberal, Republican or Democrat.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need a civil war. Democracy in the U.S. will fail without a single shot fired no matter the interpretation of the second amendment.</p>

In a world where people both have too high and too low expectations for professional sport coaches and managers, the common playbook front offices take when teams under-perform is to fire the manager.</p>

<p>Yes, change is needed, and yes, it is easier to fire one person, the manager, and not the team. But, Maddon is not the reason why the Cubs did not make the playoffs. First, and foremost the reason is that Cub players did not do their job. The same players who once ground out at bats in 2016 where doing nothing more than swing for the fences all this year. Second, the Cubs lineup is nothing but the same style hitter, with no diversity on the bench or apparently in the farm system, and the talent, that&rsquo;s on the Theo Epstein and the front office.</p>

<p>Frankly, up until this point, what Epstein and the front office have done is succeed with the easy decisions and fail at the hard decisions. How hard is it to tank year after year and stock pile on draft picks that every talent scout in America says is a good bet? When Maddon became available, was it really hard to quickly decide to drop Ricky Renteria and sign Maddon?</p>

<p>Be careful for what you ask for, you just might get it. Now Epstein has to make one of the most important decisions of his tenure, who to hire to replace the manager that guided your team to the first World Series in 108 years. David Ross might be a good guy in the clubhouse, but will he have the players attention any more than Maddon? Will Joe Girardi be too hard? Who Epstein hires is crucial towards getting the most out of all the the talented players that are now starting to enter the end of their contracts.</p>

<p>Worse of all, the attention on hiring the next manager redirects attention away from the real heavy lifting of the offseason, which is to make changes to the lineup so that you get more professional at bats. Changing the lineup means moving one of the core players who won the World Series, which is something Epstein has refused to do to date. If you only replace the manager and keep everything else the same, why should we expect a different result?</p>

<p>On Saturday Epstein announced that Maddon will not be returning. If next year is no better, who will be the scapegoat then? You can&rsquo;t fire the entire team.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The common denominator for all my favorite professional sports teams is that they were losers during my childhood. The Green Bay Packers were the siberia of the NFL during the 70s and 80s until Reggie White started playing for them in 1993 and three years later won the Super Bowl. Ever since 1993 the Packers have been at or near the top of the NFL.</p>

<p>The Chicago Cubs were the epitome of &ldquo;lovable losers&rdquo; for a century. Even though the Cubs flirted with chances to make it to the World Series in 1984, 1989, and 2003 but it hasn&rsquo;t been until the last five years that they have consistently been at or near the top of the league, and you know they won it all in 2016.</p>

<p>Like the Green Bay Packers, the Detroit Red Wings were also once the dominant team in the NHL but during the 70s and 80s they were known as the &ldquo;dead Wings.&rdquo; The owners had to give away cars to get people to come to their games. In 1997 the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup, and of my favorite teams they have won more championships in my life time, winning again in 1998, 2002, and 2008. Since the calendar turned to the 2010s the Wings have been in a rebuilding phase.</p>

<p>Finally, the Detroit Pistons where also perenial losers during my childhood but where the first of my faves that I witnessed winning a championship in 1989, and again in 1990 and 2004. Frankly, the championship they won in 2004 is one of the most gratifying because nobody really expected it and they upset the perenial champion Los Angeles Lakers. Like the Red Wings, the Pistons are rebuilding but apppear to be nearing returning to the tops of their league sooner than the Wings.</p>

<p>Over my life time I&rsquo;ve seen the long road it takes to get from basement to top floor of a professional sports league. I&rsquo;ve seen how it takes for a team to learn how to be a champion, particularly from the Red Wings who had huge playoff failures after being the best team in their league the entire season.</p>

<p>Of all my favorite teams, the Cubs have the most talent and I expect will have chances to win championships again in the foreseeable future. The MLB&rsquo;s farm system enables a franchise to have more control over its future if they have the right leadership. The NHL is similar, which is why theirs and the MLB front offices have such a huge influence on their long term success, much more than in the NFL and NBA that seems to depend much more on health and luck.</p>

<p>I am dissappointed that the Chicago Cubs will not make the playoffs this year. I will always love the Cubbies, win or lose, but I much better like where they are now, a very good team that can disappoint than a bad team that surprises.</p>

         	<p>I watched the Apple iPhone event this afternoon and found all the emphasis on the cameras to be over the top. I know that Google has received praise for the cameras in the Pixels so I get that Apple wanted to proclaim loudly they have the best camera. I am not a camera nerd, all I want is the camera on my phone to take decent pictures, which it does. I don&rsquo;t care about all the whizzywigs, and I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a smartphone because it has the best camera. It feels like Apple is still playing the features game to convince people to throw down $1k on their phones, case in point, the portion of the event that got into the details of the A13 processor.</p>

<p>When I look at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/iphone-11-vs-the-competition/">this comparison</a> of phones, I am drawn to the Pixel 3A XL because it has enough features for the lowest price.</p>

         	<p>I wonder if I am the only person who thinks Apple should do the same thing they did with the iPod and make the Apple Watch work standalone or with Windows? The tie to iPhone constrains sales, in my opinion. The iPod didn&rsquo;t really take off until it started working with Windows, and if Apple really wants to sell watches, they need treat it like a standalone product.</p>

<p>The irony is that more democracy—ushered in by social media and the Internet, where information flows more freely than ever before—is what has unmoored our politics, and is leading us towards authoritarianism.</p>

<p>The Founders of the United States did not consider democracy as the best form of government, which is why they created a Republic. We have been dismantling their invention ever since.</p>

         	<p>Home Run hitting is vulnerable to breaking down. Combine that fact with an aging starting rotation and an inconsistent bullpen and you have a summary of the Chicago Cub&rsquo;s last two seasons.</p>

<p>The Cubs currently have 5 batters with 20 or more home runs, and one more, Jason Heyward at 19. No Cubs hitter has a batting average of .300 or better, Anthony Rizzo  is hitting .286. Even if you add Ben Zobrist to the mix, the Cubs lineup is too much the same making it easy to defend.</p>

<p>I understand the resistance in parting ways with the talent that got you the World Series three years ago, but I think it should be clear now that unless there are some diferent players in the lineup next year, you are going to end up with the same result.</p>

<p>Many will put blame on the manager, but he is not the person responsible for the roster, that lies with the front office. You clearly see a bias towards a single style of player that is good but not diverse enough, and that really doesn&rsquo;t give Madden many options to change things up.</p>

<p>Ownership has some hard decisions to make during the off season. It&rsquo;s easy to decide whether or not to spend money, it is much harder to decide whether the people running your team know how to change and if you do replace them, with whom?</p>

<p>I expect the Cubs to replace Madden because that is the easy choice that just about every team makes at this point. A different leadership style might spark a different emotional result, but it won&rsquo;t change how teams pitch to the Cubs.</p>

<p>The Cubs currently do not have a single player hitting .300 or better. What you have is a lineup of power hitters, and as appealing while the home run is a fan favorite, relying on it is not winning baseball. This lineup is too easy to pitch against.</p>

         	<p>I’ve been using Chromecast ever since Google first started selling them, and upgraded to the Ultras when they became available. One is attached to each of our two TVs, however I also have an Apple TV connected to the basement TV. I primarily use the Apple TV because I find the apps are better, for example the MLB app has a catch up feature only available on Apple TV.</p>

<p>I do occasionally stream ball games using the Chromecast on the Living Room TV but it has he annoying behavior of performance degrading after a couple hours of streaming. All of a sudden what I am watching starts stuttering and becomes unwatchable.</p>

<p>I don’t have solid evidence, but I suspect the Chromecast is overheating to the point after a few hours the performance suffers. The OS on the device might be throttling down performance to protect the CPU. The Chromecast is very hot when I touch it. I probably should get an HDMI extension to move it further away from the back of the TV.</p>

<p>Given my experience, if someone is in the market for a streaming video device I recommend the Apple TV unless you find the price prohibitive. I think the UI is good and it has had solid performance.</p>

Unfortunately, it only imports a few months of historical data from Fit so I needed to wait until now to see the year over year benefit.</p>

<p>Now I can easily tell that I am walking less this week but more than last  year. I can easily see whether my monthly activity is above, at, or below my average. Exist also provides a way to track my moods and provide tags.</p>

<p>A few things that I wish Exist provided are a direct way to enter sleep information, similar to mood tracking. I don&rsquo;t use devices to track my sleep but I would like to simply be able to enter the times I went to bed and got up and provide a rating for how I think I slept. Not scientific, but a start.</p>

<p>I would like it to integrate with food tracking apps, or provide a direct way. Right now I am using LoseIt mostly to track carbs.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish it provided me a way to create my own queries/reports of data.</p>

<p>Overall I am happy with the service and can recommend it. Web, Android and iOS applications are available.</p>

         	<p>The Chicago Cubs have one of the best home records and one of the worst road records, and they have the best run differential in their division. People seem to be scratching their head over how the same team can be so good at home and so bad on the road. The problem is not the hitting, although they could be more consistent. To me the problem is the bullpen, they are giving up too many runs in the 6 thru 9th innings. Nobody in the pen is reliable.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago the bullpen wasn’t so important because starting pitchers pitched more innings and more often completed games. Now, starting pitchers are only expected to pitch six innings and that means you got have more pitching than ever before.</p>

<p>The Cubs overall pitching staff is not good enough. You might see an uptick in performance if they make the playoffs because the starters tend to go longer and you tend to narrow the pen down to a handful of pitchers, but I don’t expect the Cubs to get beyond be first round if they do make the playoffs.</p>

<p>I don’t know what specific things the Cubs need to do for next year. I don’t think the problem is with the managing or coaching, it seems to point to the talent in pitching. Lester and Hamel will be a year older and there doesn’t appear to be any replacements coming from the minors. The window on the talent the Cubs do have is getting smaller and it will be a shame if they only make it to one World Series.</p>

         	<p>Each year we try to celebrate our wedding anniversary on vacation to spend time together. This year we traveled to Marquette, Michigan, stayed at the <a href="http://www.thelandmarkinn.com/">Landmark Inn</a>, took a tour of <a href="https://www.picturedrocks.com/">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a> in Munising, and then on our way back spent an evening at <a href="https://www.midarkskypark.org/">Headlands International Dark Sky Park</a> near Mackinaw City.</p>

<p>Here are pictures that we took during the trip:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/foJ4t8eyWpLWRkXu5">Landmark Inn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ca9x8kVr16NfKGZMA">Pictured Rocks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D3ZwuDngt3mz9Brb6">Headlands International Dark Sky Park</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I defintely recommend all three venues. Pictured Rocks might be the closest thing I&rsquo;ve seen to the Grand Canyon east of the Mississippi. The Dark Sky Park is a great place for star gazing, just be sure the moon isn&rsquo;t too bright and you have clear skies.</p>

         	<p>During Presidential elections we hear a lot about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/warren-rural-policy-iowa/index.html">the plans</a> the candidates have for what they will do if elected. We want the candidates to have plans and we need to hear what they are, but we also tend to obsess over them a bit too much because for the most part they don&rsquo;t have direct control over their implementation.</p>

<p>A President needs to get Congress to pass legislation to implement his or her plans. Consequently we gauge their potential success of whether the President&rsquo;s party has a majority in the House and Senate.  Reality is that this rarely happens, and even so there may be members of the President&rsquo;s own party who don&rsquo;t agree, therefore what we need to evaluate is how persuasive a candidate is and whether they can lead compromise.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we really tend to think of our candidates as dictators and that has manifested in Donald Trump. The founders did not intend Presidents to have such power, the representative republic they established vested Congress with job of governing by representing the citizens (House) and the states (Senate). In fact, through the electoral college, the Congress was intended to ultimately decide who is President.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>23 Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. 24 Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, 26 for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. 27 As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 28 There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A23-28&amp;version=NRSV">Galations 3:23-28</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too radical? Perhaps so for religions and countries birthed by Anglo-Saxons. If you call yourself a Christian, how do you imagine the Kingdom of God that Jesus constantly talked about looks like? Being one in Christ does NOT mean we are all the same like #AllLivesMatter. Being one in Christ means we see Christ in everyone and everything through our different skin colors, nationalities, and genders.</p>

Only $31m was set aside so, the more asking for a piece the smaller the size. What did they expect? The credit monitoring thing is just a way for Equifax to profit off the event, so that shouldn&rsquo;t be an option. Besides, with so many breaches already taking place I already have several forms of monitoring in place.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fine should have been larger&hellip; you know,  a real penalty.</p>

<p>Oh, and dear FTC&hellip; let&rsquo;s do something real like replacing Social Security Numbers with something more secure.</p>

         	<p>Very good advice, this, I put it up there with the idea of a bucket list. I don&rsquo;t have a bucket list, life is the bucket. I also try to live by the motto of no regrets, which I personally mean to give my all to the moment and give myself the room for mistakes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regrets, should we have them, are better addressed in the moment I think. We can apologize for our mistakes. We can make amends when we’ve hurt people. Most importantly, we can resolve to be better <em>now</em> instead of assuming things will work themselves out someday. We all know, at least at some level, that someday may never arrive.</p>

         	<p>Among our problems is a lack of understanding about some fundamentals. One is that greatness is not self-determined. Claiming that I am great does not make me so, that makes me arrogant. Whether or not I am great is determined by others who know me or work with me.</p>

<p>So, when Trump says &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; one should ask, who determines whether America is great? How do they determine that America is great?</p>

<p>Likewise, I don&rsquo;t think I can declare that I am not racist. I hope I am not, but I think only those of other races could determine whether or not I am racist by my actions and my character.</p>

<p>White man declaring he is not racist does not make it so, or does one white man saying another white man is not racist does not make it so.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/06/24/in-a-youtube.html">The Risk Of Identifying As A Platform</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/06/24/in-a-youtube.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-24 11:50:00 -0400">Jun 24, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In a YouTube video recently posted, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&amp;v=W5g4sPi1wd4">Bill Gates said</a> something along the line of his greatest failure was to not lead Microsoft to produce a mobile operating system that would have been as successful as Android.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Everything-Windows-Mobile/dp/B002IKLN6K">I had an up front view of Microsoft&rsquo;s mobile operating systems</a> in the early 2000s and for Microsoft to create an Android would have required something akin to a labotomy. The Microsoft of the early 2000s saw itself as a platform company, that platform being Windows, and as a consequence, its prime objective was to protect the platform because to do so was to protect its existence.</p>

<p>To make something like Android Microsoft would have had to be willing to create a new platform rather than try to extend a desktop platform to mobile, which was doomed for failure. Microsoft could not fathom creating a second platform because to do so, in their mind, was to put Windows at risk. (Microsoft also applied the same thinking to the Internet.)</p>

<p>In my opinion the most important thing Satya Nadella did when we took over Microsoft is return to Microsoft&rsquo;s roots as a software developer and move away from identifying itself as a platform company. As a software developer Microsoft does not see it&rsquo;s entire existence depending on Windows, which allows it to embrace other platforms such a making a robust version of Microsoft Office for iOS and Android and even to integrate Linux with Windows.</p>

<p>Had Microsoft not got drunk on the Windows platform, starting with Windows 95, it might have been willing to embrace the Internet and mobile more fully and maintained itself as, in Bill Gate&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;the&rdquo; leading software company rather than &ldquo;a&rdquo; leading software company. It&rsquo;s easy to get drunk on the amount of money successful platforms provide and appear to provide forever.</p>

<p>Platforms are an institution, and most institutions naturally expend tremendous effort on self preservation. In my opinion the only way a platform company can truly exist over time is by being willing to put it&rsquo;s current platforms at risk of extinction through the creation of more viable future platforms. In my opinion some people in Google know this and that appears to be the reason why they are <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/google-fuchsia">quiently working on Fuchsia</a> but only time will tell whether this insight is fully embraced by those who are running the company.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/05/29/for-a-president.html">For A President, Congress Is The Law</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/05/29/for-a-president.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-29 20:59:24 -0400">May 29, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I wonder, if the Republicans controlled the House, whether there would already be an impreachment inquiry open. Mueller served the role as investigator, collecting evidence and documenting his findings. The Constitution gives the House the job of prosecuting attorney (not the Attorney General) in determining whether to charge the President with a crime, which for the President has the unique label of impreachment.</p>

<p>A Republican inquiry would review the evidence, formally declare there is none to bring charges, and then the case is closed. Until the House says it is closed, the case is not closed no matter what Trump or Barr says. That is the Constitution.</p>

<p>To uphold their oath to the Constitution, Democrats in the House must open the impeachment inquiry and determine whether or not to vote articles of impeachment. They must be willing to take the political risk, if that exists, to fulfill their role in our government. It’s not about politics, it’s about the rule of law.</p>

<p>In fact, I think Congress should produce new presidential special consule legislation that states that all presidential special consule investigations require an impeachment inquiry to formalize the conclusions of the investigation.</p>

<p>If the criminal justice system cannot bring charges against a sitting president then Congress has to take serious this responsibility. That is unless Congress thinks the President really is above the law.</p>

<p>Mueller did the same thing as the Watergate investigation, he laid out the case for Congress to draw a conclusion on impeachment. In short, his entire effort was to layout the evidence for an impeachment inquiry to draw a conclusion, which exactly what the Constitution intends. If the House does not open an inquiry then it is discrediting Mueller&rsquo;s work and not upholding their own oath to the Constitution. In the end, they might not draft articles of impeachment, but they absolutely should open the inquiry.</p>

<p>Props to Amash for having the integrity to put his oath over party loyalty.</p>

         	<p>The <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/crostini">Crostini</a> Linux containers on my Google Pixelbook melted down after I upgraded the Pixelbook to the stable release of Chrome OS 74, a reminder that Linux Apps (Crostini) is very much in beta.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/crostini-failure-after-chrome-os-74-upgrade">the details</a> of what occurred, the trigger seems to be that I had two containers. After Chrome OS 74 installs and you launch a container, such as by starting the Terminal app, you see a message telling you that the Linux apps is being upgraded and the app you wish to run will load after the upgrade completes.</p>

<p>I saw the message for the primary container, named penguin, and everything worked as planned. The meltdown began when I started Gnome Terminal, which was in the second container, the one in which I was running Docker. The upgrade message appeared but the upgrade did not seem to complete. After letting it run for an hour, which was much longer than the prior upgrade, I restarted the Pixelbook, and either that or the upgrade rendered the container usable.</p>

<p>From here a few attempts to fix the problem cascaded the meltdown to primary container too. My attempts to re-build and restore the primary container from a backup failed and I am left to re-building from scratch. Not totally awful given that I had no real data in either container, just apps with a bit of data synced to a cloud or github.</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure what happened. I might have been too impatient and the second container may have upgraded had I just let it run. Or, it might be that running Docker in the second container created problems.</p>

<p>The moral of this blog post is that even if you are sticking to the Chrome OS stable channel, Linux Apps (Crostini) is still in beta and thus breakage can and will occur.</p>

I&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/google-io-2019">a wiki page</a> to capture information from the conference this year. The biggest news from the keynote were hardware related.</p>

<p>One is the consolidation of Google Home and Nest, the Nest brand remains. With this consolidation is a new video hub, the Nest Hub Max.</p>

<p>The other big news was the announcement of two new, power priced phones, the Pixel 3a and 3a XL. While not unexpected, still interesting timing given that Google announced the Pixel 3/3XL last October.</p>

<p>The setup process for moving from one iPad to another is pretty neat. It automatically detects the old nearby iPad and establishes a connection to it by scanning a barcode with the camera.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been having fun breaking and fixing my wiki over the last several days, and in the process learned more about wiki. Wiki is written in nodejs and there is a wiki-server and a wiki-client along with several plugins. My adventures began when an update was made to wiki-client that broke the ability to use HTML forms in a wiki page. A fix was made to wiki-client that resolved the problem but my server was not getting the update.</p>

<p>It appears that somewhere along the line I managed to install wiki in two different directories on my server. The install from which I was running wiki was not updating when I ran npm install -g wiki and it took me a while to figure out how to <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/run-wiki-from-global-installation">run the global install instance of wiki</a> that I was updating.</p>

<p>Today I removed the &ldquo;second&rdquo; installation but now I have to provide the full path to the correct, current, installation of wiki. When I just run wiki it tries to run it from a directory in which it is no longer located. I must have an alias or script pointing it in that direction but for now I haven&rsquo;t figured it out.</p>

<p>Anyway, I now have the current verison of wiki-client so I can now fill in html forms, one of which is for a search plugin that now appears to be broken. Oy vey! Search works on a older installation on my Pixelbook, but the new version/current version is not working.</p>

<p>At least I did manage to get the graphviz plugin installed (you can see it in action <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/preview-next-diagram">on this page</a>), figuring out how to set up myself as an admin user to do the installation took time to suss out.</p>

<p>Breaking and fixing things is a important part of the learning process when learning software.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have competition when the system is gamed, and those who argue against &ldquo;single payer&rdquo; health insurance always hinge their argument on competition.

         	<p>Read <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3384713/the-end-of-the-desktop.html">this piece</a> about desktop computers in Computerworld. I&rsquo;ve long sought a cloud-based Windows desktop on demand that I can access from my iPad thinking I may need one as I personally move away from Windows on the computers I own. I know how I can do that in a variety of methods but it is turning out that I really don&rsquo;t need it.  I do 95% of my personal computing in a web browser, which is what Chrome OS is optimized to provide.</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/04/02/i-have-been.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-04-02 12:53:28 -0400">Apr 2, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been reading Dave Winer&rsquo;s writing for a long time, and a common theme of his writing is journalism. My translation of what he has been saying is that news has become a platform, and as such anyone can do it, and those who are employed as journalists need to shift from being gatekeepers to being participants. True platforms route around gatekeepers.</p>

<p>The reason why this message is not well received by journalists is obvious, it&rsquo;s because <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html">what they hear is that you no longer have a job</a>. Staying employed is important to these people and you cannot blame them because it is how they support their families.</p>

<p>When the constitution was written people like Benjamin Franklin viewed journalism as a vocation because frankly the idea of a &ldquo;job&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really exist. When vocations became professions, a shift in priorities took place, with maintaining employment moving to the top. When journalism transformed to media thanks to corporate consolidation, the move to journalism being about money became complete.</p>

<p>The honest question that has been avoided ever since is, is what we have, journalism as media to make profits, consistent with the &ldquo;fourth estate&rdquo; established by the First Amendment? If the prime objective of the Consitution, of which the First Amendment is a part, is to be the United in the United States of America, then today&rsquo;s media is not that which the first amendment refers to because there is more profits generated from disunity than unity.</p>

<p>Citizens instinctively know that the profits that corporate ownership demands is corupting, and therefore they do not trust media because they know there is a bias towards making money over telling truth.</p>

<p>Of course Fox News is giving their viewers what they want to hear, that is how they make money! Of course MSNBC is giving their viewers what they want to hear, that is how they make money! Of course the New York Times is giving their readers what they want to red, that is how they make money!</p>

<p>On and on it goes. It is another example of how hyper capitalism is destroying republican democracy and thus destroying our country.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In December micro.blog stopped exporting my site to Github, a consequence of their change from jekyll to hugo as the CMS. We do have manual ways to export a site, one is to download an export file as a Wordpress export and the other is to generate an archive in a &ldquo;blog archive format&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be well documented. Manton wrote <a href="https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html">a post</a> proposing the format in 2017, but I have not found anything else so it doesn&rsquo;t appear that format is useful to anyone other than programmers.</p>

<p>An export is only as good as the ability to import, so I decided to create a local install of <a href="https://medium.com/@tatemz/local-wordpress-development-with-docker-3-easy-steps-a7c375366b9">Wordpress on my Pixelbook using Docker</a> and then try importing the Wordpress export. The good news is that the import was successful. <del>The bad news is that the export file retains markdown that is not converted to HTML so none of the links in the posts appear correctly. We either need the micro.blog export process to convert to HTML or some way for the import process to convert markdown to HTML.</del></p>

<p>Update: I was directed to install the JP Markdown plug in to my site, which I did and then did a wipe and re-import and the good news is that with it installed all the markdown formating is appearing on the local Wordpress site.</p>

         	<p>Oddly, one of the challenging things about wiki is creating new pages. A new page is created by first creating a link to the page and then adding items to that page, therefore I have <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/recent-changes/view/now">the Now page</a> on which I create new links.</p>

<p>The problem is, those new links can accumulate over time and then I have to back and remove them. I have found code for an HTML form to create a new page so that I can enter a page title, click create, and a new ghost page appears.</p>

How do you get people to switch and why should they if they can use their existing credit card with Apple Pay?  I get the desire to make money on transactions, that is a repeat of the Apple Store model that makes Apple a lot of money. However, in this instance I don&rsquo;t see why I or anyone would switch.</p>

However, it seems to me one thing we don&rsquo;t consider is that what might be the best way to address the problem is to enable people to have a good life where they currently live.  People who are well off in South America don&rsquo;t take the risk of traveling thousands of miles to the United States, desperate people take that risk. Building a wall is not going to stop people from taking that risk. A wall is a band aid, not a solution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Commerce Department said this week that despite two years of America First-ism, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit is getting worse rather than better.After all the fuss about the tax cuts, it turns out that corporations benefited, not workers. And while joblessness is  at an all-time low, the economy turns out to be churning out many more jobs at the bottom end of the skills market than middle-class jobs. Wages still lag, city centers are still rotting, infrastructure projects are still crumbling, public housing is still in trouble.  Oh and then there is this massive debt resulting from unpaid for tax cuts.  At the border, the Trump protectionist approach appears to be not working, as the monthly immigration numbers attest.</p>

<p>Actually, some will say that Trump&rsquo;s election is a shake up of the two party system. He is certainly not a conservative Republican it is arguable whether he is a Republican at all.</p>

<p>The problem with Congress is that it has become nothing more than an extension of the President&rsquo;s &ldquo;team.&rdquo; Congress doesn&rsquo;t exist as a separate entity and therefore does not fulfill is role as the second branch of government, and that is bad because Congress&rsquo; role is fundamental to the republican form of democracy created by the Constitution.</p>

<p>To desire to keep down the rate of wages, with the view of favoring the exportation of merchandise, is to seek to render the citizens of a state miserable, in order that foreigners may purchase its productions at a cheaper rate; it is, at most, attempting to enrich a few merchants by impoverishing the body of the nation; it is taking the part of the stronger in that contest, already so unequal, between the man who can pay wages, and him who is under the necessity of receiving them; it is, in one word, to forget, that the object of every political society ought to be the happiness of the largest number.</p>

<p>Insurance is really about probabilities and statistics, and insurance companies are essentially gambling on the premise that there is a lower probability of paying out money than taking in money.</p>

<p>Car insurance is real, one might go a life time without ever having to file a claim yet must pay for it regardless if you own a car. (BTW, in most states one MUST buy at least liability insurance.)</p>

<p>If car insurance were like health insurance one would be filing a claim every time they took their car in for an oil change or some other repair.</p>

<p>With the frequency of payouts, the real question is, why would any private corporation want to even be in the health insurance business? The only way it can be profitable to a corporation is to take in more money by charging more than they pay out. Can you not seen the fundamental problem here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the close of the Cold War, some commentators concluded that the American experiment had ended in triumph, that the United States had become all the world. But the American experiment had not in fact ended. A nation founded on revolution and universal rights will forever struggle against chaos and the forces of particularism. A nation born in contradiction will forever fight over the meaning of its history.</p>

For people concerned about the performance impact of Crostini running on a Chromebook, I note that the virtual machine and any containers within do not automatically start on boot and therefore the cleanest way to run is to not launch the Linux Terminal app, which you see when you enable the Linux apps beta on Chrome OS.</p>

<p>The first time you launch the Terminal app the virtual machine (termina) and default container (penguin) start, which accounts for the longer than perhaps expected time to launch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The United States is in a state of emergency: 28 national ones and many more local. This might come as a surprise, but it isn’t new—this month marks the start of our 39th year in a continuous emergency state. What is an emergency, and how did we get here? This post explains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1976 National Emergencies Act requires Congress to meet every six months to end the state of emergency. If you want to know why Democracy is failing in the United States, read no further than the following&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not once has Congress met to consider such a vote. It is not exactly clear why. But the provision would have lost much of its intended force even had Congress complied: It originally allowed Congress to end an emergency by concurrent resolution (that is, if majorities in both houses voted to end it). But in 1983, the Supreme Court declared this sort of legislative veto over presidential action unconstitutional. A 1985 amendment to the act now requires a joint resolution to end the emergency, meaning that any Congressional vote to end the emergency is subject to the president’s veto, which may be overridden only by two-thirds majorities of both houses.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve had the same reaction to Howard Schultz&rsquo;s comment about the American Dream <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/31/213234.html">as Dave</a>. When I was growing up the American Dream was equated to the Middle Class, by which I mean adults aspired to having a comfortable life and dreamt of a better life for their children.</p>

<p>While I do agree with Schultz in that another way to describe the American Dream is to be successful, I think the biggest problem is measuring success by wealth. The focus on wealth in America is allowing us to accept the huge income inequality that exists in our country.</p>

<p>For me, Schultz implying that Elizabeth Warren and others want to punish him and others for being successful is totally wrong. What we want is for the very wealthy people to contribute a share to society commensurate with their ability.</p>

<p>Schultz might want to put on an indepedent label, but his ideology is conservative Republican selling himself as a Democrat Ross Perot.</p>

You should be nervous, and the U.S. Constitution gives you the power to open the government, you simply override the President&rsquo;s veto. You serve the citizens of the United States, you do not serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States. Your job is not to just enable what the President wants, your job is to write laws that govern our country. Do your job. A good first step is to pass and override any veto to the appropriations laws to open the government. The next step is to replace Mitch McConnell as your Senate leader.</p>

<p>Simply serving at the pleasure of your party&rsquo;s President is in practice nothing more than a monarchy/authoritarian rule. If you truly believe in democracy, if you are to uphold your oath to the Constitution, you will exert your authority as the co-equal branch of government who has as one of its primary purposes oversight of the executive branch of government.</p>

<p>Do your job. The Republic depends on you, otherwise we slip in to the same tyranny from which we revoluted against and it will be under your watch and will be your legacy.</p>

&gt;The exorbitant prices confound patients and doctors alike since insulin is nearly a century old now. The pricing is all the more infuriating when one considers that the discoverers of insulin sold the patent for $1 each to ensure that the medication would be affordable. Today the three main manufacturers of insulin are facing a lawsuit accusing them of deceptive pricing schemes, but it could be years before this yields any changes.</p>

         	<p>So, Mitch McConnell is the literally the person causing the shutdown because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2018%E2%80%932019">as the Republican Senate majority leader</a> he refuses to take up the appropriations bills passed by the House of Representatives. Blame Mitch not Trump.</p>

<p>If you recall from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otbml6WIQPo">How A Bill Becomes A Law</a>, Congress has the ability to override the President&rsquo;s veto. So, if the Senate passed the bills passed by the House, they go to the President, and if he vetos then is back in Congress&rsquo; power to override the bills in which they become law.</p>

<p>So once again, Congress has within its power given to it by the Constitution to govern and like so many times in the past Mitch McConnell is not living up to his oath.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to start putting pressure on the Republicans and McConnell.</p>

         	<p>The real problem with social networks like Facebook and Twitter is that they require using their servers that store all of what you write and share. By nature of the fact that you are using their servers Facebook and Twitter have the right and ability to access what you write and share.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2588287/networking/networking-peer-to-peer-network.html">peer to peer network</a> takes a server, like Facebook and Twitter&rsquo;s, out of the middle. What you write and share goes directly from your computer to the computer of others on the peer to peer network. Because this information can actually end up on many more computers most peer to peer networks encrypt what is passed around. Consequently, only the people who have access to your public or private keys can actually read what you write. (By the way, in a simple way I have just explained one reason why <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/">blockchain</a> has been written so much about.)</p>

I think of Micro.blog as a hybrid decentralized environment, but which I mean you can use it to either store content on their server, like I do, or use it to facilitate content you store an other site.  I store what I write on <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my blog</a> and transmit copies of that to Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<p>However, I suspect that if it becomes dead simple, reliable, and secure, a peer-to-peer type of network like <a href="https://infourminutes.co/whitepaper/scuttlebutt">Secure Scuttlebutt</a> will be the winner.</p>

<p>What is also important to understand is that what has been going here is emotional manipulation, that is what advertising is all about. Generations of Americans, starting with the Baby Boomers, have been programmed with emotional manipulation, which is why now, seemingly all of a sudden, &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; is such a thing. The Internet is an echo chamber of emotional manipulation, which is why the social network hacking has been so effective.</p>

         	<p>One thing I remember President Reagan  ask for is the ability to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto_in_the_United_States">line-item vetos</a>.  The thing is that the Constitution provides the power of the line-item veto to Congress through its ability to write and pass legislation. Trump is pulling an anti-Reagan move, demanding something added to legislation that Congress has passed.</p>

<p>Compromise, which does NOT mean that one side gives in to another, is the whole point upon which the Founders built our government.</p>

No Congress should give a President a blank check.

<p>For full leukaemia to occur, another biological event must take place and this involves the immune system. “For an immune system to work properly, it needs to be confronted by an infection in the first year of life,” says Greaves. Without that confrontation with an infection, the system is left unprimed and will not work properly.”</p>

<p>This book is a proposal to rethink religion so that our definitions are both more accurate and more inclusive of the variety of religious experience around the world. It also is an argument that there is a way to be religious and modern, open minded, progressive, appreciative of science, tolerant, and a peaceful global citizen of the 21st century.</p>

For this new work, Richard shortened almost every chapter, changed some chapters significantly and dropped seven chapters from the previous edition. He added three chapters that discuss John the Baptist, Paul and grief. The former afterword has become a very different chapter two, “Is There Such a Thing as Masculine Spirituality?”</p>

<p>I think part of the reason why Russia&rsquo;s influence on the 2016 Presidential election was so effective is the conditioning we have had through the emotional manipulation of advertising.

<p>As we in news and media attack the platforms and their every misstep — and there are many — we need to turn the mirror on ourselves. It was news media that polarized the nation into camps of red v. blue, white v. black, 1 percent v. 99 percent long before Facebook was born. It was our business model in media that favored confrontation over resolution. It was our business model in advertising that valued volume, attention, page views, and eyeballs — the business model that then corrupted the internet. It was our failure to inform the public that enabled people to vote against their self-interest for Trump or Brexit.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Made my third trip to the eye glasses place to get my new glasses adjusted and confirm that the prescription is right and the measurements are right. I have a pretty significant stigmatism and the introduction of progressives has complicated the process of getting new lenses. Every pair I have had since progressives has required multiple trips to get the fit right, and one time the lenses had to be remade.</p>

<p>Today I got the manager/customer advocate take care of me. The first lesson learned is that for my prescription, experience matters. The customer advocate confirmed the measurements are correct and he did adjust the frame so that the glasses now feel better and sit better on my face.</p>

<p>I learned that my progressive prescription changed pretty significantly for my right eye, so that means I would definitely have a noticable difference and need more time to adjust. Most importantly, he told me that due to the change I need to hold what I am reading closer to force my eyes to read through the progressives. Holding a book where I had in the past put it at the mid-way point, which causes strain. Nobody told me this, I don&rsquo;t know how I was supposed to know.</p>

<p>So, now I know I have to change what I do and I have to give my eyes/brain time to adjust. These simple but important pieces of information should have been given to me either at the first appointment or when I first picked up the glasses. My theory about this customer experience is that the experience of the people taking care of you matters. They probably don&rsquo;t see my particular prescription often, and then 20 somethings doing the work simply don&rsquo;t have the experience to handle my prescription.</p>

If you look at the Discuss link on <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/12/21/if-there-were.html">this post</a>, you see that it points back to the discussion thread on micro.blog. What if when you tapped that link on iOS it launched the micro.blog app? Right now it just opens the thread in a web page. On Windows if you are logged in to micro.blog you can actually reply and participate in the discussion.</p>

<p>You see, I think of micro.blog as a blogging platform and not as a Twitter alternative so I envision the blog is a starting point and not the micro.blog timeline. If one starts on the blog and I want follow up discussion, I should be able to make it happy. Adding a link like I did is easy enough.</p>

         	<p>The iPad and <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> is evolving into my preferred blogging platform due to a shortcut I created that quotes text from web pages in the exact format that I prefer. I use Omnibear in Chrome on my notebook computers but doesn&rsquo;t automatically grab the web page title, address, and selected text like the shortcut. I think I used to have a bookmarklet that did the job back during my earlier blogging days.</p>

<p>Oh, and the fact that Drafts makes it easier to link to pages doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>The problem is, I don&rsquo;t only use my iPad, so when I am reading on another computer it is a bit disruptive to have to switch computers to write a blog post.</p>

The scientific method is based on the truth that ideas, hypothesis, can be wrong and hence requires proof of  hypothesis that is peer reviewed and consensed as being right or most likely right. Proofs are not only facts but also consensed arguments of what is most likely right.

         	<p>I think that unregulated capitalism is really survival of the fittest applied to wealth. Left unchecked, as it mostly is today, pure capitalism leads to monopolies that destroy any real free market.</p>

<p>I am encouraged by <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-introduces-accountable-capitalism-act">Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s Accountable Capitalism Act</a> even if I am skeptical it will result in real legislation. This topic needs to be addressed because of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in the 1980s a new idea quickly took hold: American corporations should focus only on maximizing returns to their shareholders. That had a seismic impact on the American economy. In the early 1980s, America&rsquo;s biggest companies dedicated less than half of their profits to shareholders and reinvested the rest in the company. But over the last decade, big American companies have dedicated 93% of earnings to shareholders - redirecting trillions of dollars that could have gone to workers or long-term investments. The result is that booming corporate profits and rising worker productivity have not led to rising wages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smith, 61, retired after the 1997 season with more saves than any player before him. His saves still rank third all-time behind Mariano Rivera and Trevor Hoffman. A seven-time All-Star and three-time Rolaids Relief Man Award winner, Smith led his league in saves four times, including a career-best 47 in 1991, and had 30-plus saves in 10 of his 18 seasons with the Cubs, Red Sox, Cardinals, Yankees, Orioles, Angels, Reds and Expos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lee Smith more or less ascended to the closer role after Bruce Sutter went to the Cardinals, and was the Cubs closer through my high school years. He was a classic power pitcher who occasionally would grove a fastball for a home run. Sutter is in the Hall of Fame and I think it&rsquo;s right that Smith joins him.</p>

         	<p>A REPLY TO RICHARD ROHR ON THE COSMIC CHRIST – Omega Center
Ilia Delio,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christ is the communion of divine personal love expressed in every created form of reality—every star, leaf, bird, fish, tree, rabbit and every human person. Everything is christified because everything expresses divine love incarnate.  However, Jesus Christ is the “thisness” of God (‘God is like this and this is God’) so what Jesus is by nature everything else is by grace (divine love).   We are not God but every single person is born out of the love of God, expresses this love in his/her unique personal form and has the capacity to be united with God.  It is for this reason that the Franciscan theologian Bonaventure described the mystery of Jesus Christ as a coincidence of opposites.  Because Jesus _is _the Christ, every human is already reconciled with every other human in the mystery of divine so that Christ is more than Jesus alone; Christ is the whole reality bound in a union of love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we say, “Jesus is the Christ,” we are saying that the humanity of Jesus is one with divinity, the “mystery hidden from the beginning of the world.”   There is a particularity here, a <em>haecceitas</em> (or thisness) that cannot be overlooked.   Jesus _is _the Christ which means all that God is, is given to us in Jesus, rendering a new understanding of God as relational, self-communicative, self-emptying.</p>

         	<p>I recently built <a href="http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">my own Federated Wiki server</a> and have been having a lot fun adding content to it since. I&rsquo;ve found that for me it is the best way to maintain a &ldquo;Now&rdquo; page of things I am currently working on or researching.</p>

<p>As a topic comes up, I got to <a href="http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/now">the Now page</a> and create a wiki link to the topic, which I then click to create a new page to which I start adding content.</p>

<p>What I need to determine is what to do with the topics that I complete. I think the ideal solution is a plugin that automatically generates an index of all pages in my wiki so that even when I remove the wiki link in the Now page, a link to the page remains somewhere so that it can be found later. I could manually build an index, but in this day and age I would think an automated approach would be possible and best.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/11/30/a-few-weeks.html">Planting A Garden</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/11/30/a-few-weeks.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-30 19:37:46 -0400">Nov 30, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A few weeks ago I read <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</a> by Mike Caulfield and it really resonated with me. In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden.</p>

<p>One thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked. My affinity toward structure is also why I find outlines appealing.</p>

<p>Chronology (reverse), archives, and permalinks are structures of blogs that I think distinguish it technologically from &ldquo;regular&rdquo; web sites. The informal personal voice of blogs is what distinguishes the blog writing style from other writing styles you see on the web.</p>

<p>And yet, blogs writing is also point in time. One writes a blog post, it enters the stream, and beyond perhaps that first day one rarely, if ever, edits or adds to a blog post.</p>

<p>The ongoing revision of a piece of writing is fundamentally what I think Caulfield means by &ldquo;the garden.&rdquo; With that paradigm, I created two &ldquo;projects&rdquo;, the first being a web page in which I originally wrote about <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html">which Chromebook I was going to buy</a> and then continually revised that page as I learned more up until I made my decision. The second project is a new page in which I am recording <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/11/25/google-pixelbook.html">my experience with using the Pixelbook</a>.</p>

<p>In both instances I created and maintained those pages using jekyll and offline tools like Drafts and Typora, which I find works very well. However, it feels that a wiki is more in tune with the garden concept which is why <a href="http://testing.frankmcpherson.net">I have been dabbling with wikis</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, this whole thing is work in progress. I think I favor the offline ability I have with my jekyll and Netlify set up versus in browser editing required by DokuWiki.</p>

<p>Wear OS Update H installed on my watch two days ago. There appears to be a problem recovering from the new &ldquo;deep sleep&rdquo; / suspend mode. At intermittent times the watch appears to be unresponsive, basically it looks as though it is frozen after I attempt to wake it by either moving my arm, tapping the screen or pressing the crown. Eventually it does come back/recover, which leads me to suspect the watch has gone in to suspend/deep sleep and takes a long time to resume. I appreciate the idea of saving battery life by going into such a state, but the watch needs to recover much faster as right now it is a horrible user experience. Is anyone else seeing this? Is this a known problem with a fix in progress, or is there a way to disable this &ldquo;feature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started to notice this behavior yesterday. I&rsquo;ve restarted the watch in hopes that might resolve. My fear is that this is a processor issue causing this watch to not be able to resume from this form of suspend fast enough.</p>

&gt;And as for the outdatedness, the current Fortran standard is Fortran 2008. The next one is 2018 and it is expected to arrive anytime soon. Fortran is constantly being modernized one little step after another. The biggest holding factor here is its mission. It must remain simple for real engineers.</p>

<p>When I started college in 1984 Fortran was the language taught in the introductory programming class required by computer science and engineering students. Advanced computer science classes used Pascal. Java did not exist then.</p>

<p>While the Lenovo and HP Chromebooks that I have been looking at have an 8th generation Intel processor, the Pixelbook is an overall better machine and I imagine its 7th generation Intel processor will server me equally well.  On the other hand, that U processor in the Lenovo is definitely better performing that the Y processor, which Apple choose for the new Macbook Air.</p>

<p>I had not considered the Pixelbook due to normal $999 price. The sale price is in line with the version of the Lenovo C630 I am considering. Food for thought, does anyone have advice on which one to go with?</p>

<p>Would there even be a debate about whether an iPad can be one&rsquo;s only computer if touchscreens were invented before the mouse? IMHO the major impediment is iOS&rsquo; lack of support for Bluetooth mice.</p>

<p>I think if Apple wanted to, they could take a cue from Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/">Project Crostini</a> to add containerized desktop app support to iOS. The Pros would be smart enough to handle containers, while the normal users would probably not want nor need it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long mused that what we really need are devices that have built-in hypervisors upon which one could run any operating environment they wished. Containers come close to this idea.</p>

         	<p>I am not feeling euphoric by seeing Democrats win the House. I am heartend by the number of women who ran and won, but this is just the first step. Before <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/11/democrats-trump-investigations/">the Dems go crazy with investigations</a>, they should consider why Trump won in the first place. We need progress on real issues more than we need revenge.</p>

<p>If the Democrats in the House fall into the trap of Washington nazel gazing this small victory could lead to a Trump re-election in 2020. Yes, provide oversight, but more importantly listen to <strong>all</strong> of your constituents and try to do something to help them!</p>

         	<p>The pricing and models for the Lenovo Yoga C630 are confusing.

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve been traveling over the past week, visiting family and friends throughout Michigan and Wisconsin. This morning I am packing up to depart on the next leg of my trip and struck by how few bags I have on this trip.</p>

<p>Ten years ago when I made this trip I packed one or two plastic bins for power cords, surge protectors, WiFi access points and more. I may have had a few bags for computers and then my regular luggage.</p>

<p>Now, all of my electronics that includes one notebook computer, two tablets, and their associated cords all fit in to one backpack. I have on suitecase and that is it. Obviously, the electronics that I carry is much smaller than ten years ago, but I am also helped by updated hotels with plenty of power outlets and WiFi. No more hunting around and moving furniture to find an available outlet.</p>

         	<p>I am trying out <a href="https://www.trunknotes.com/">TrunkNotes</a>, which I learned about here on micro.blog. TrunkNotes is a personal wiki very similar to <a href="https://www.voodoopad.com/">VoodooPad</a>. <del>One thing I am trying to recall about VoodooPad is whether it automatically creates links to new pages for wiki words, I thought it did while TrunkNotes does not. TrunkNotes will create a link to a page if one associated to the wiki word already exists and I find that more limiting than if the app automatically created links whether the page already existed or not. The current method requires going back to edit pages to add links to other pages.</del></p>

<p>Found out that I did not create a valid wiki word, which is why TrunkNotes did not auotmatically create a link for a new page. It turns out TrunkNotes works exactly as I want it to.</p>

<p>I am planning to by a new Chromebook this year, and I am working on an article that describes which ones I am considering and why. As I was writing that article to occurred to me a more fundamental question I needed to answer is why am I even considering Chrome OS? Consequently, I&rsquo;ve written the above to be foundational to the next article.</p>

<p>I think blog posts are a form of writing that is under appreciated. First, few people remember that blog is actually a shortcut for weblog, literally a log of the web. Most log entries are short descriptions.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t write this to criticize, there is no right or wrong, instead I want to point out that a blog has always meant to be simple and true to one&rsquo;s voice. You don&rsquo;t have to write volumes nor have a witty title. Just link to something on the web and perhaps explain why you think it worth sharing. For that matter the blog can simply be for yourself.</p>

         	<p>My Notes From The Apple Event</p>

<p>Tim Cook was max PT Barnum at the Apple Event, which I find annoying after listening for 20 minutes. At this point they can just move on to the announcements, the forced excitement and employee enthused applause is becoming old.</p>

<p>The $1200 price for the new MacBook Air is pretty much what I expected. Given how the MacBook has been redesigned, I am not sure why one would not just get a MacBook rather than an Air.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Mac Mini got a nice spec upgrade retaining the $800 price, which is cheap for a Mac but not so much relative to other desktops. I guess if you want a low cost Mac, the Mini is the one to get, as always.</p>

<p>The new iPad Pros were the star of the event, and they have me wishing I did not buy my iPad last year. For me the slightly larger screen and CPU upgrades are very appealing.</p>

<p>Can the new Pencil work with older iPad Pros? I need to learn more about the Pencil, and if it works with old Pros I may buy one. Can 2 Pencils connect to an iPad at the same time?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A human being,” wrote Einstein in reply, “is a part of the whole, called by us “Universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a founda tion for inner security.”</p>

         	<p>The gist of <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2801077-packers-put-aaron-rodgers-in-impossible-situation-and-he-keeps-delivering">the articles</a> currently being written about Aaron Rodgers and the Packers is that the Packers are wasting what time they have left with Aaron. Frankly, I had the same complaints about how the Packer&rsquo;s treated the second half of Brett Farve&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>You have one of the best, if not the best, quarterbacks in the league, but you do not keep him surrounded by good talent. Good receivers, running backs, offensive line, or defense. You put in place a coach who frankly doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a sense of urgency.</p>

<p>The Packers were very fortunate to have drafted Aaron and that he was better than they most likely thought when he was drafted. Most teams do not replace one hall of fame quarterback with another hall of fame quarterback. It is not likely they will do the same when it comes time for Aaron to step down, and that means that every season that Aaron plays in which you don&rsquo;t win a Super Bowl could be another year added to many, many years of not winning one.</p>

         	<p>We saw Elton John last night for the first and last time, as this is his farewell tour and I believe it to be true. The show was fantastic, particularly when you consider that Elton is 71 years old. He played for a little over two and a half hours, with no intermission. After each song he would stand up, acknowledge the crowd as he did a circle around the piano seat, take a drink of water, sit down and launch into another song.</p>

<p>I’ve never seen a musical act with so much percussion. Two full drum sets, three drummers, including tympani, bells, and tambourine. The dude playing the tambourine, which was well miced, got more video time than the guitars. The act, however, had no cowbell.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple notes on Little Caesar’s Arena. It was the first concert that we attended at LCA. In an email the day before we were told the arena would open at 6:30 PM and encouraged people to come early, Elton was starting promptly at 8 PM. The arena didn’t open until 7 PM, which was very annoying.</p>

<p>We had seats in the upper bowl, which frankly were the cheapest seats. The climb to the seats in the upper bowl is pretty steep, and I felt bad for some of thr elderly and disabled who made the climb.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Google classifies the Pixel Slate as <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate">a Tablet with Google Assistant</a>. Based on <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/11/my-definition-of.html">my definition of tablets</a>, the Slate is not a tablet, it is a 2-in-1. If you stick to Google&rsquo;s view of it as a tablet then I stand by <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/09/first-reaction-to.html">my initial impression</a> that the Slate could be DOA.</p>

<p>My concerns about it are driven by the total cost of ownership. I start with the 8 GB, 64 GB, Intel Core M model that costs $799, and then add a keyboard, either the Google keyboard that costs $199 or the <a href="https://www.brydge.com/pages/gtype-keyboard-for-google-pixel-slate">Brydge G-Type</a> that costs $159, making the minimum total cost $958; throw in the pen and that is just north of $1,000. For my money I much rather buy the Pixelbook or any one of the newer Chromebooks than pay $1000 for the Slate 2-in-1. Arguably <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-6/8zcnc665slq5?icid=surfacedept_nav3_surfacefamily_100218&amp;activetab=pivot:techspecstab">the Surface Pro 6</a> is a better option, and it would definitely be better for me because I know I can use a pen with OneNote.</p>

<p>The Slate does look like a nice piece of hardware, and if you want Android and Linux apps on a 2-in-1 it&rsquo;s your only viable option, but is that option more appealing than an iPad Pro? Particularly a newer, larger screen, same form factor, smaller bezel iPad Pro? I am skeptical.</p>

         	<p>I do not think we should define a tablet as a screen without a keyboard, instead a tablet ought to be defined by how it is most commonly used, by which I mean you mostly use it in portrait orientation like one would a notepad of paper or a book.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a tablet has at least a 7-inch screen and is comfortable to hold and use for long periods of time with the device in a portriat orientation. Consequently devices that claim to be a tablet that have a 12-inch or larger screen are not really tablets, they really fall into a tweener (with notebooks), 2-in-1 category.</p>

<p>Based on how I use my iPad Pro 10.5, it is more a 2-in-1 because it is mostly used in landscape or when in portraint lying on a desk. By my defintion the only true tablets that I own are the iPad Mini 4 and the Nexus 9. The iPad and it&rsquo;s 9.7-inch screen is probably the largest screen size for a tablet.</p>

<p>My tablet use case definition might account for why tablets have not really overwhelmed the market. Apple had great initial success with the iPad, but sales started to taper off until the introduced the Pro line and significantly decreased the price of the regular iPad. The Pro line really fills the 2-in-1 market, while the lower price iPad has gained sales from holdouts who have wanted one the past but found them too expensive.</p>

<p>Further, by my defintion, the most successful tablet maker is likely Amazon with their cheap 7-inch and 8-inch tablets.</p>

         	<p>I have a hard time swallowing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17956202/google-pixel-3-price-expensive-why">the $150 price increase</a> between the Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel 3. I know Google can set prices the market will bear, but when I look at the difference I ask myself is the price increase due to higher costs or a desire for a higher profit margin?</p>

<p>Just about every Android phone that I have owned, from the original T-Mobile G1 to my current Pixel 2, has been either a Nexus or Made by Google phone because I value having the pure version of Android that is directly and quickly updated by Google. Having suffered during my Windows Mobile days of delayed software updates due to OEM timelines, I have tried to avoid such situations.</p>

<p>I want to keep using Pixel phones, Google seems to want to be in the premium priced smartphone market. What can be done? Google can follow Apple&rsquo;s lead into that premium market by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Continue to support older Pixel phones for several more future releases of Android. Google forced me to by a Pixel 2 because it announced Android 9 will not support the Nexus 6P, which I previously owned. In short Google should not continue only providing two operating system upgrades for their Pixel phones. The latest version of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-12/">iOS supports five generations</a> of iPhones and Android needs to do the same for Pixel phones.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep selling at least two generations of Pixel phones and lower the price of the older generation. Right now the Pixel 2 is still available at the Google Store, but for how long? I think Google needs to keep selling the Pixel 2 until it announces the Pixel 4, which then builds in a lower priced Pixel.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems clear to me that smartphone prices have gone up across the board because Apple increased the price of the iPhone. I don&rsquo;t like the iPhone prices either, but there is one big difference today between iPhone and Pixel. The iPhone you buy today will very likely be able to run the version of iOS released four years from now, so you don&rsquo;t need to buy a new iPhone in two years, you cannot say the same thing about Pixel.</p>

<p>The combination of the $150 price increase, Apple&rsquo;s practice to support older models of iPhones and selling older models at lower prices has me considering for the first time a switch to iPhone. I value the ability to receive updates direct from the source of the operating system.</p>

<p>I prefer Android smartphones and I don&rsquo;t want to switch, so I hope Google will make the changes I describe above. I also need to take a closer look at <a href="https://www.android.com/one/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxvbdBRC0ARIsAKmec9bTgjNYnJ15XF1F-mkVu7nflgaw0voIk5MP2xEAMm3dJTzgbDVSttgaAse-EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CJLe6oWB_N0CFYLewAodBBgKTA">Android One</a>, which may clean Android with updates from Google at a lower price. The bottom line is that Googe needs to know there is more to providing a premium phone than a price increase, and paying $800 for a phone that will only get operating system upgrades for two years makes no sense.</p>

         	<p>Looking back, it occurs to me that <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html">my analysis</a> of the Cub&rsquo;s performance in last year&rsquo;s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.</p>

<p>The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer&rsquo;s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.</p>

         	<p>The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.</p>

<p>On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.</p>

<p>For me the Cub&rsquo;s chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana&rsquo;s ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub&rsquo;s need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer&rsquo;s bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer&rsquo;s bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.</p>

<p>Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don&rsquo;t think Maddon will manage in such a manner.</p>

         	<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job.</p>

         	<p>I think the smart watch market is fascinating. On one hand you have Apple, with one design and software innovation and on the other hand you have a multitude of watch designers producing a variety of different looking watches at different price points using comparatively mediocre Wear OS. It also highlights the advantage of designing your own chips because Wear OS has been constrained by slow chip development by Qualcomm.</p>

<p>BTW, if one is in the market for a Wear OS watch, wait until when watches with the new chips release later this year, early next. I know a number of new watches are being released to coincide with the new version of Wear OS coming next month, but I expect the new chip to provide better battery life and processing for the future.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.</p>

<p>In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web&rsquo;s permanence, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">European Union even has a law</a> in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.</p>

<p>If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.</p>

<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html">Dave currently thinks</a> Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.</p>

<p>To Dave&rsquo;s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.</p>

<p>The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.</p>

         	<p>I don&rsquo;t get <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/03/after-nike-hires-colin-kaepern.html">the mindset of conservatives</a>. They say things like they want small government and want government out of people&rsquo;s lives and yet they want to dictate their beliefs to people with whom they disagree.</p>

<p>If America is about liberty, then one expressing that liberty by protesting is in fact a high form of patriotism.</p>

<p>Second, people need to understand that public displays of patriotism, which is what standing during a national anthem is, is done by non-democratic countries too. Such displays are not uniquely American. See above for what is uniquely American.</p>

<p>Finally, in my upbringing kneeling is a sign of reverence. One can make the argument that kneeling is even a higher display of respect than standing. If Colin and the other NFL players did something like turn their back, or lie down, or start break dancing THAT would be disrespectful.</p>

<p>Worse, what is most disrespectful to veterans is not voting. Actively working to prevent citizens from voting. Not challenging the President when he sends our military in to conflict. And not demanding that Congress uphold its constitutional responsibility to declare war. Wouldn&rsquo;t making sure every vet gets the physical and mental health care they need be a true sign of respect? What is more respectful, actually caring about active military and veterans or puttinng on appearances of respect?</p>

<p>P.S. Go to any sporting event and you will find people walking, talking, and otherwise not paying attention during the national anthem.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been running the new version of Google Fit for four days, and I am pretty happy with the change. I had already made the mental shift from steps to move minutes. Fit has even suggested in an increase in my goals after using the defaults and monitoring my activity for a few days.</p>

<p>One problem that I do have with my watch, which is a Fossil Q Explorist, is that the battery life has been worse since upgrading my phone to Android P. I am not sure that is the exact correlation, but it feels to be the case.

         	<p>I think of micro.blog as a publishing platform, for two reasons. First, what I write is published to <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my blog</a>. Second, what I write is published to other distribution channels, specifically for me <a href="https://twitter.com/frankm">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank">Facebook</a>, but it could also include Medium and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>What would make micro.blog perfect for me is the ability to designate, at the time I am writing, to which distribution channels I want a particular item published to. All things that I write are appropriate for my blog, but some things I might only want to also be published to Twitter and yet other things I would prefer published to Facebook.</p>

<p>To me, the ability to control what gets published where, from the app in which I am writing, is particularly important if I were to publish to the LinkedIn and Medium channels that could be considered more &ldquo;professional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now, cross-posting is all or nothing. Everything I write in micro.blog is cross posted to Twitter and Facebook and frankly some posts, like this one, don&rsquo;t make sense for those audiences.</p>

<p>I recognize there are drawbacks to cross posting, specifically, it&rsquo;s a write once experience meaning that edits don&rsquo;t get re-published to Twitter and Facebook because there just isn&rsquo;t a mechanism to do so.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Unlike most others here at micro.blog, I consider <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/">my micro.blog</a> as my blog. The reason is that I distinguish blogs from long form writing and publishing on the Internet. For me, a blog post is 1 to 3 paragraphs and written in about 15 minutes or less.</p>

<p>I blog to share a thought or something of interest to me, I write to formulate and share ideas.</p>

<p>When I set up my micro.blog account and associated a personal blog domain to it, I decided that I would use my then current blog, <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">Let&rsquo;s Be Frank</a>, for long form writing. The &ldquo;broad&rdquo; push to HTTPS is going to make that a problem because that blog is managed using an app written by Dave Winer called <a href="http://1999.io">1999.io</a>, and it has a lot of Javascript libraries that I don&rsquo;t think he is every going to convert to HTTPS.</p>

<p>So, stay there and maybe figure out how to convert to HTTPS or look somewhere else? I recently <a href="https://www.baty.net/2018/back-to-netlify/">learned about Netlify from Jack Baty</a> and after checking out its web site, I determined it has much of what I was looking for: <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">low price</a>, easy HTTPS implementation, and flexibility.</p>

<p>Netlify does not provide a Content Management System, but it integrates with Github to provide continuous deployment, so you can use static site generators like Jekyll for publishing content. Since I have a little experience with Jekyll, I decided to try out Netlify by following <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/">their Jekyll tutorial</a> and it didn&rsquo;t take me long to get a site up and available via HTTPS.</p>

<p>The upside with the approach I have so far is that I can write and publish content from any device, particularly my iPad. All you really need to do is add a file in the proper naming format to the posts folder of your Github repository. I&rsquo;ve cloned the repository to Working Copy on my iPad and found a Drafts action that will save a new item to Working Copy and insert the proper header informatation that Jekyll requires.</p>

<p>Right now <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net">the new site</a> is very much a work in progress and there may be changes. Oh, and I am aware of the irony of me writing this post here but this is is where you know me and I am not a stickler to such self determined rules.</p>

         	<p>Too many people in the United States think our government will be overthrown by force when the reality is it is happening in just the opposite manner. The strong arguments against gun control in the U.S. is evidence of this, as the argument centers around needing to keep guns as protection against government oppression. The powers that be don&rsquo;t need to take guns away, they just need us to keep arguing about them, which fossilizes idealogy and keeps attention away from what is really happening.</p>

<p>The constitution enables authoritarianism when Congress and the Supreme Court do not function in their jobs as overseers of the Presidency. When Congress and the Supreme Court simply align with a president due to party affliation, you have a dictator in practice.</p>

<p>Today the process nearly complete, and gerrymandering will seal the deal. Gerrymandering removes the one power citizens have, which is to vote. You don&rsquo;t need to burn down the flag nor rip up the Constitution, all that is needed is idealogical compliance to what the Presidency wants.</p>

         	<p>Tolerance is fundamental to freedom. If we stop tolerating actions or opinions that we disagree with, you stop freedom, democracy disappears and is replaced by dictatorship. The irony is for the idea that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful and should not be tolerated, we are giving up the very freedom that too many gave their lives for.</p>

<p>You can not dictate respect. Dictating respect is counter to tolerance and is counterproductive because respect is earned, not given.</p>

<p>Do you really want freedom? If you do, it starts by tolerating those with whom you disagree and not treating them with contempt.</p>

         	<p>One thing I find frustrating about iOS are the number of apps that all seem to do the exact same thing. How do you decide on one over the other? An example is Drafts and Ulysses, both are good markdown editors but Drafts supports more automation. Last summer I was looking for a new editor and Ulysses came highly recommended, so I bought it, but then the company switched to a subscription model and that turned me off, I decided to not buy in to the subscription.</p>

<p>Then I learned about Drafts, and so I went and downloaded it and have used it to write some blog posts. To date I have mostly used it to write long posts for <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">one site</a> that only has a &ldquo;basic&rdquo; web-based editor. Of course, Drafts has now been recently upgraded and it too has a subscription model.</p>

<p>To me, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have Ulysses and Drafts on my iPad, Drafts seems to able to do the job good enough. However, so far I have not seen an Action for sending text to Wordpress, which I find a bit surprising. Does anyone know of such an Action? The one in the Drafts directory appears to require components not part of Wordpress.com.</p>

<p>To me, what makes micro blogging different from social networks like Twitter is the permance I describe above, and therefore editing should be a fundamental requirement for all micro blogging apps.</p>

         	<p>Google has released the new version of Gmail, which I am checking out. I have been using, and like, Inbox mostly because how quickly I can use it to triage email. By triage I mean browse for messages I want to read and then quickly archiving all the remaining messages. No other app, including Gmail provides as easy a way to archive a group of messages.</p>

<p>The downside of Inbox is that it is very JavaScript heavy and therefore the web app performance can suffer. Another downside is that the app versions don’t look as good on larger screens such as on my 10.5 iPad Pro in landscape.</p>

<p>So, I am considering using Gmail on large screens and Inbox on small screens. However to decide that, I need to use the new Gmail for a while.</p>

         	<p>Did a little more investigation into <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/04/22/i-got-a.html">the watch face that Fossil &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to my smart watch last weekend</a>. What happens is, you receive a notification saying that you &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; a face and whether you want to enable it. What I have found is that amongst the many faces that are pre-installed on the watch is one called Seasonal, and this is the face that Fossil pushes updates to. Consequently, Fossil is not consuming additional storage space on the watch with each &ldquo;new face&rdquo; as it is updating one face that is designed for different appearances, which in reality is how all faces work.</p>

<p>I am wondering whether there is a Wear OS app that will automatically change watch faces I specify on a set schedule. I would like to rotate through some like the Outlook face that I like to use during the work day.</p>

         	<p>What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising.</p>

<p>If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don&rsquo;t see how in any way that infringes on a person&rsquo;s free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person&rsquo;s ability to make money on cable TV.</p>

<p>Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.</p>

Before we can fix problems we have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Agree on what is the problem</li>
<li>Agree that the problem needs to be fixed</li>
<li>Understand that the solution to every problem (healthcare) is not a hammer called capitalism</li>
<li>Agree on fundamental principles</li>
</ol>

<p>Fundamentally, the business model for insurance is based on the premise that a company pays out less money than it takes in through people buying insurance. Property insurance works because it is possible that people who pay for it never need to file a claim through their life time. Likewise auto insurance works because there are people who never have to file a claim over a lifetime of driving.</p>

<p>In context, there really is no such thing as health insurance because every health care transaction is paid by the &ldquo;health insurance&rdquo; companies and just about everyone has one or more healthcare transactions per year. In other words, how does a &ldquo;health insurance&rdquo; company make money? If auto insurance was like healthcare, ever time one took their car in for an oil change or a tire rotation they would file an auto insurance claim.</p>

<p>Basically, we have to stop thinking that there is a capitalistic solution to the cost of health care. Just about all other countries around the world came to this realization and did something about it. We in the United States have drunk the capitalistic koolaid so much that we have forgotten our own history and just run around trying to hammer away every single problem.</p>

         	<p>A couple of thoughts about OmniFocus after reading <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018">Omni&rsquo;s roadmap for 2018</a>.
As an iOS user but not a Mac OS user, I have long heard about OmniFocus and how great it is but never tried it out. A few weeks ago I discovered I could install the iOS version and try it out for free for two weeks, which I did and frankly, it didn&rsquo;t seem much better than Todoist or 2Do.</p>

<p>My main requirement is multi-platform support because while use an iPad as my primary personal computer, I  also use Android smartphones and Windows notebook computers. The inability to get to info in OmniFocus from Windows has been a show stopper, and web access, which is on the roadmap, will help, however I am concerned about the &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; plan.</p>

<p>A simple way that Omni could solve this problem is by syncing with Toodledo. While there is a Toodledo iOS app, it is not very efficient so I use 2Do on my iPad that syncs my data with Toodledo. The benefit is that there are Toodledo apps for other platforms, and the Toodledo web app is one of the most advanced web apps that I use.</p>

<p>I am also surprised that OmniFocus doesn&rsquo;t use an outliner for editing projects and tasks, given the existence of OmniOutliner, which I do use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep a watch out for the next release of OmniFocus and probably check it out.</p>

<p>One might not agree with the entire premise of the above article, but I think there is something to the point being made that we wrongly think markets/capitalism is the solution to every problem in our country. In fact, one can make the argument that capitalism is the root of much that is wrong in our country.</p>

<p>For example, the reality is capitalism (read revenue and profits) is the true reason why the NRA agressively opposes any gun control; the NRA&rsquo;s corporate supporters make a lot of money off the sale of guns and ammunition and logically do not want any of that money to be at risk. Just like capitalism drove the tobacco industry to ignore studies showing smoking causes cancer.</p>

<p>For a long time I have been saying that we tend to confuse capitalism with democracy. I think this is reflected most prominently by the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/">Citizens United</a> SCOTUS ruling that says corporate spending on politics is a form of free speech, and thus corporations have a right to free speech.</p>

<p>Corporations are a construct of capitalism, they are not in themselves men or women of any race. In otherwords, corporations are not citizens.</p>

<p>Citizens United may be the worst SCOTUS ruling of my lifetime. Worse, it is reflects a flawed understanding that frankly skews society in favor of corporations and the oligarchs that profit from them.</p>

         	<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of the year and therefore the time for my yearly ritual of trying to find a to-do (task management) app that I like and think that I will use. I am again finding myself with <a href="http://www.toodledo.com">Toodledo</a>, mostly because it has more filtering features that other apps and because it has a robust web app. However, Toodledo does not have a robust iOS app.</p>

<p>The Toodledo iOS app does the job but doesn&rsquo;t have the best UI. However, I have found that 2Do syns with Toodledo so I am giving that a try. At worst I can toggle between the two apps because they sync with the same data.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, 2Do does not sync Toodledo&rsquo;s statuses, so if I want the same functionality I need to create tags rather that statuses.</p>

         	<p>Later today Michigan Tech will play Bowling Green in the championship game of the 53rd Great Lakes Invitational hockey tournament. It is the first GLi at the new Little Caesars&rsquo;s Arena and is hosted by Michigan Tech.</p>

<p>Either of the potential opponents for Tech in the championship presented interesting story lines. Had Michigan won Tech would be facing their former coach, Mel Pearson, who just left his Alma mater to become Michigan&rsquo;s head coach. Tech&rsquo;s return to college hockey prominence started when Pearson took the helm.</p>

<p>Pearson&rsquo;s last game as Tech&rsquo;s head coach was the 2017 WCHA championship game in which <a href="http://www.wcha.com/men/pres1617/201703/mar12wcm.php">the Huskies beat Bowling Green</a> to take the Broadmore Trophy and the NCAA tourney bid. What better way for the Falcons to gain revenge for that loss than by beating Tech in their tournament in the new arena and carry home the MacInnes Cup, named for legendary Tech coach <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_MacInnes">John MacInnes</a>?</p>

<p>If we think deeply about the consequences of debt you see meaning. Holding debt over a person is to have power over that person. The person in debt therefore is more or less a slave to the person (or thing) that has power over them. One of the earliest themes of what Jesus did for us was to set us free.</p>

<p>As we in the United Stated look more and more like the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi">Ferengie</a> every day, it may be helpful to replace the word &ldquo;sin&rdquo; with &ldquo;debt&rdquo; more often.</p>

<p>Looks like I will have to remove the Zero and flash the card with a complete build on a PC. I hope that  I can get the Zero out of he case without breaking it.</p>

<p>Apparently, when something I ordered is delivered to the locker, I will get an email with a six digit code that I then use at the locker location to retrieve my package. I have three days to pick up the package otherwise it will be returned for refund. Perhaps best of all, lockers can be used as a drop off location for returns.</p>

<p>Given the rise in people having deliveries stolen, I can see these lockers becoming useful for valuable items being shipped for which you may not be hope to sign for.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Despite scientific research and Congressional hearings, the NFL is still not serious about the safety of its players due to concussions. In fact, the current NFL rules <strong>rewards</strong> teams of players who inflict a concussion.</p>

<p>The latest example occurred during the Packers and Panthers game on December 17. During the game Panther Thomas Davis launched into Davante Adams resulting in Adams being removed for the game due to the obvious helmet-on-helmet hit. A personal foul was called on Davis, but he remained in the game while the Packers lost one of their most important players.</p>

<p>Players who may be concussed must be removed from play until doctors confirm it is ok for him to return. In this case, the right thing happened while that has not always been the case. However, how is it that the player causing the injury, unnecessarily, is still allowed to play?</p>

<p>Treating concussions is important but equally important is preventing concussions from happening in the first place, and that will not happen without immediate and significant enforcement on the field. All direct hits to the head should result in an immediate ejection, and this rule should be enforced not only by on field officials but also by replay. At a minimum the NFL ought to have a booth review, as is the case with the NCAA, but I favor the booth being able to eject such players at any time.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the current approach of only reviewing and penalizing such plays after the game is over is not sufficient in deterring such hits and violates the spirit of the game. The life time health of the players demands extreme action. If the NFL is unable to police itself then Congress must step in with regulation. Right now it appears profits are outweighing safety.</p>
