			 <p>Finding that a company is a monopoly matters less than determining a proper remedy, which is not the same as punishment. The purpose of the remedy in antitrust law should be restoration of competition in the market in which a company is deemed to monopolize.</p>
<p>The judge has found Google to be a monopoly in a very specific market, and so the remedies that ought to be decided on should be intended to restore competition in that market. My interpretation of the ruling is that Google is a monopolist of the market of selling text ads as part of web search results and it gained that monopoly by paying Apple and Mozilla to be the default search engine of their products.</p>
<p>In my opinion the remedy in the context of the market above is specific and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what Ben Thompson suggests<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, prohibit Google from entering contracts to make Google Search the default search engine for other products and dissolve existing contracts. I do not think breaking up Google would have any affect of restoring competition in the text ad in web search results market. Note that such a remedy would not prevent a company like Apple to continue to use Google as the default they just wouldn&rsquo;t get paid by Google to do so, and I wonder whether not allowing Google to be selected as the default for a period of time would be more harmful to Apple or Mozilla than Google. In fact, Apple and Mozilla stands to lose a lot money from such a remedy.</p>
<p>Some will suggest that Android should be split of as a separate company, but does Android have a significant amount of share of the smartphone market for that to matter?  I don&rsquo;t think so, and consequently the more meaningful remedy is tied to Apple. If Apple is not paid by Google to be the default search engine on Apple products, would Apple choose Bing or DuckDuckGo?</p>
<p>We learned from the Microsoft Antitrust case in the 90s that final resolution of antitrust law takes a long time and markets will change during that time. What is more likely to happen is that by the time the case moves through the appeals process to the Supreme Court users may be using AI-based tools in place of Google search.</p>

		<a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2024/07/31/after-the-trade.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-07-31 09:23:00 -0400">Jul 31, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Officially the All-Star game is considered to be the half-way mark of a MLB season, but the real mid-season milestone that matters is the trade deadline. The actions taken by a team by the trade deadline indicate whether the team management thinks it can make the playoffs, if they do then they will try to make trades that help the team win in the current season, otherwise they start work on the next season. Jed Hoyer&rsquo;s comments that he was focusing on 2025 was indication that Cub&rsquo;s management doesn&rsquo;t expect to make the playoffs this year.</p>
<p>Last season the Chicago Cubs were surprising buyers at the deadline, having gone on a winning streak that convinced Jed Hoyer the team had the shot at a wildcard spot, but that didn&rsquo;t happen and David Ross the scapegoat. Now this season, after signing Craig Counsell to the highest salary of any MLB manager the Cubs are last in the NL Central with a 51-58 record and they are seven games out of the last wild card spot. In short, the Cubs are  likely not making the playoffs this year. Are they going to fire Counsell?</p>
<p>Even though the playoff positioning is different between last year and this year, a fair assessment is that the team is really no better than  the year before, nor the year before that or any other year up to 2016. What we have is the same problems of unreliable hitting and pitching from the bullpen. The fact that the 2024 team&rsquo;s starting pitching has been so good is as much an indicator of how much MLB has changed since 2016 than anything. It used to be that teams with strong starting pitching were winners, but the game now does not rely so much on starting pitching to win games.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of starting pitching in the game today is to not lose the game in the first five innings by not giving up more than three runs, the bullpen is expected to now win every game by not giving up any runs. If that weren&rsquo;t bad enough, hitting is a completely lost art in baseball, with hitters needing only a .244 batting average to be considered good. The game has come down to this, pitching keeping the opponents from hitting home runs until your own batters hit two or more home runs.</p>
<p>The Chicago Cubs line up has been made up of the similar type of unreliable hitters for nearly a decade now, which is a clear indicator to me that the front office&rsquo;s idea of what is a major league hitter is out of sync with reality. As long as Hoyer is running the Cubs they will not be any different, and so it&rsquo;s on ownership to recognize the insanity of continuing to do the same thing and expecting a different result.</p>
<p>If I were the owner of the Chicago Cubs, now that the trade deadline has past, I would fire Hoyer immediately to signal that it&rsquo;s time for a change. Take the time to review and interview people over the remainder of the season to find the right replacement to have your new front office in place before the off season begins in earnest.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am convinced that a problem, may be even &ldquo;the&rdquo; problem, is that there is too much religion in America, and people do not recognize this problem because they have a too narrow definition of religion. Religion is anything, usually a group of people or an institution, to which one identifies themselves with and is loyal to because they derive meaning from that group. For example, complete this sentence, &ldquo;I am&hellip;.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you are like me you will find yourself making many &ldquo;I am &hellip;&rdquo; statements that not only include faith-based groups like &ldquo;I am Christian&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am Muslim&rdquo; but also, &ldquo;I am a father,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am a woman&rdquo;, and also &ldquo;I am a Green Bay Packer fan,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am a NASCAR fan&rdquo;. For too many today, their answers are also &ldquo;I am a Republican&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a liberal&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a conservative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So many groups to which we bind our selves to and that which demand our loyalty. I think all of these religions, yes even the faith-based ones, tend to be practices of idolatry. My understanding of religion explains how <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Donald Trump has managed to change what it means to be an evangelical Christian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to a person who supports Donald Trump rather than a person who believes in the divinity of Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus is not the founder of the religion known by 90% of the world as Christianity, that religion was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine. Jesus founded a movement, a way from religion that demands our loyalty toward our true selves as kin of of the divine, the divine that simply is &ldquo;I am&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>I am of the opinion that the U.S. Presidential election cycle is too long and tool expensive. Time is needed for a good democratic process, but still what we have is too long. We are now testing whether a short election cycle can work. Personally, I think it will because it is easier to build and sustain energy for a few months rather than a year or more.</p>

			 <p>Over the years I have heard it said that the Democrat and Republican political parties are essentially the same. To the extent they are both political parties, this is true, but I think the real consequential factor in the United States since 2016 is how different the parties have become. How it came to be that Biden dropped out of the 2024 Presidential race as the Democrat candidate will not and cannot happen in the Republican party because nobody in that party has the willingness, strength of character, or courage to challenge its king. The 2024 Federal and State elections are truly about two different parties. Democrats will challenge their leaders, and I believe would impeach and convict their President if found guilty, Republicans will not challenge their President nor impeach him let alone convict him, as we have seen them do when the House impeached Trump twice. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it imperative members of Congress put their oath to preserve, defend, and protect the Constitution above party.</p>

			 <p>What I know is that Jesus taught love expressed as forgiveness as non-violent resistance against the idea that the only way to peace is through violence. Practicing hope, faith, and love is our tools. I have found the best way to feel hope is to practice gratitude. The question is not why there is evil in the world, the real question is why there is any good! Whether you chose to follow Jesus or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/198594-when-i-was-a-boy-and-i-would-see-scary">Mr. Rogers</a>, look for the good that is all around you, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A27&amp;version=NIV">do not be afraid</a>.</p>

			 <p>I agree with all of <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/07/20/124109.html">Dave&rsquo;s points here</a> about the Democrat candidacy for President. As much as I dislike straight party voting, I think in this election, no matter who are the actual people running, our votes are for either a Democrat or Republican governing.</p>
<p>We need to be focusing more on the Senate than the President. The Senate&rsquo;s power to convict an impeached President is now the only constitutional check against the President. We cannot trust Republicans to impeach one of their own no matter what they do, this is how far over the cliff Republicans have gone.</p>
<p>Finally, I think there needs to be much more talk about how Trump politicized a national emergency (COVID). The moment Trump started prioritizing federal assistance to states with governors who bend the knee to him is the moment he showed how he thinks and feels about people.</p>

<p>Most of Crossan’s writing puts the teaching of Jesus within our human evolutionary challenge. Human ego desires to be in control and believes there can only be one, and this norm of civilization sees the only way toward peace is violence. (The fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a metaphor for human ego.)</p>
<p>Jesus teaches that there is another way, one of nonviolent resistance practiced by love of opponent (enemy) and neighbor, expressed by forgiveness. I am convinced that left to our own ego driven evolution, humanity with destroy itself. Only the Way taught by Jesus will save us from what appears to be inevitable.</p>

			 <p>The way political parties vet their candidates for President is through primary elections. Democrats making claims that Biden&rsquo;s advisors have been shielding him really ought to be pointing fingers at the DNC.

			 <p>Seems to me that the SCOTUS ruling yesterday means that any order the President gives to the military is lawful. In other words, it sure looks to me like SCOTUS has made it perfectly legal for the President to overthrow the government because the military cannot discern what is lawful and not lawful. If the Senate is about to convict the President on articles of impeachment, the President can just order the Military to take over/arrest Congress and how are they going to be able to say that is not a lawful order?  Bear in mind, the military is the actual ultimate authority of the United States. No police force and no citizen militia can stand against it, the only possible intervention would be another military. No person given the power of absolute immunity should be commander and chief of the military.</p>

			 <p>As far as I can tell, one of the main measures that a typical person has for inflation is the price of gas. Many complaints I read about Biden are related to gas prices. I don&rsquo;t think there is an honest understanding of how gas prices work, in my opinion gas companies take advantage of every opportunity (wars, disasters, oil refinery issues) to bump up prices that rarely return to prior levels for any length of time. Do you think we will ever see gas below $3 per gallon (on average) again? Is this the fault of the President of the United States, or is it the fault of greedy corporations?

			 <p>The main reason why I have invested in and use Google&rsquo;s hardware, mostly phones running Android, all these years is that I believe the idea of &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->organizing the world&rsquo;s information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; best aligns to how I think about personal computing. Years ago I wrote about these ideas and how I saw the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->emergence of smartphones and tablets as the true, real, personal computing moment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->defined personal computing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as hardware + software (apps) + Internet + intelligence and believed then that Google was closest to meeting this definition with what was emerging as Google Assistant.

			 <p>Over the last year we&rsquo;ve seen Microsoft, Google, and now Apple demonstrate what they are doing with AI.  As a somewhat casual observer, it seems to me all of these announcements fall in what I will call a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; category. Microsoft added a ChatGPT bot to Bing so Google had to add Gemini chat to Search. Microsoft added AI features to Office and Google did the same to Gmail and Docs. The problem with this matching of functionality is that both companies are focused on each other rather than their customers.</p>
<p>The main challenges to broad use of the latest AI tools are how easy they are to use and explaining what specifically they do and why a person should want to use them. So far the most publicized uses are enhanced search, writing, and creating pictures. In a way not unlike<!-- raw HTML omitted --> how the handwriting recognition of the Apple Newton Messagepad was treated<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, there is more attention put on how these AI tools are doing things wrong and often times with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hilarious results<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Personally, my use of GPTs has been as an enhanced search, and I prefer to do my own writing.</p>
<p>How Microsoft and Google have handled AI as response to each other is not surprising because honestly that is how these companies operate as they are competing against each other for corporate customers. Microsoft and Google both have retail consumer products but these are layers on top of a corporate DNA, and frankly it shows. Apple&rsquo;s DNA has consumers woven from top to bottom and we see and feel this in their actual products and how they talk about them, and frankly that makes them more relatable and trustworthy to consumers.</p>
<p>While I find it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hokey<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the &ldquo;branding&rdquo; of these features as &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Intelligence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; is consistent with Apple&rsquo;s opinionated approach to all technology. Apple&rsquo;s message is clear, they are not going to use AI in the same way as others, so much so that they call it something similar to but not the same was what others call it. Apple is saying AI is not Artificial Intelligence, it&rsquo;s Apple Intelligence.</p>
<p>Of course, Apple is doing the same thing as Microsoft and Google in adding AI features to their first party products, but there is a key differentiation between Apple and these others,  Apple is a hardware company and AI might be the biggest gift to Apple&rsquo;s long term prospects since the mobile phone. The biggest question at Microsoft and Google right now is, how can they make money from AI, and it turns out that for them the AI revenue flow looks the same as advertising and search, but that is not how AI generates revenue.</p>
<p>The hottest company on the planet right now is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nvidia<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, who manufacture the processing chips (GPUs) AI needs to quickly provide results. Ever since Apple announced they put their M1 processors in iPads and similar high end processors in the iPhone, there have been questions about why Apple is putting all this processing horse power in these products when it will never be fully used. The answer to that question should be obvious now, that processing power is needed to run these new AI tools with performance similar to Nvidia. People expect Apple to keep their data on their iPhones, iPads, and Macs and their processors allow them to do that.</p>
<p>I own the Macbook Air that has Apple&rsquo;s first M-series processor, and its going to be three years old in November.  The Macbook Air M1 does everything I normally do, web browsing, checking email, some writing, crunching numbers, so fast I can&rsquo;t imagine when I will need to replace it for these purposes. Last week I installed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ollama<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on this Macbook Air so that I can run AI models like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->llama3<!-- raw HTML omitted --> locally and for the first time since I&rsquo;ve owned it the Macbook was slow! Before this I imagined the reason why I would replace this Macbook Air is that Apple no longer supported it in the latest release of OS X, which could be ten years from now, but now I know that if I want to run future models locally I will want a newer Macbook.</p>
<p>Cloud-based AI has it&rsquo;s place in providing widely available information in a comprehensible manner, but when it comes to actually doing things for people, that AI processing will need to be on the edge and near the people. The people behind <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Rabbit R1<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Humane AI Pin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recognize this, but both are physically small and thus constrained. The perfect AI edge device is the smartphone, and so AI fits &ldquo;glove-in-hand&rdquo; with Apple&rsquo;s core consumer product, while neither Microsoft or Google have such product. For Apple AI is not the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; and it will never be the &ldquo;thing,&rdquo; their &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is Apple silicon put in iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and AI makes the best case for the need of that &ldquo;thing&rdquo; than anything that has come before.</p>

			 <p>Google has released <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an update to NotebookLM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that allows one to provide specific sources to Google&rsquo;s Gemini LLM, store the results from questions about those sources, and write and store your own notes. I first learned about NotebookLM from Steven Johnson who advised Google in its development of this product. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Johnson is the author of several books<!-- raw HTML omitted --> such as &ldquo;How We Got To Now: Six Innovations That Made the Modern World&rdquo; and has used DEVONThink for is research and writing. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Johnson describes NotebookLM<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as the type of tool he would find useful in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->his research and writing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, suggesting that NotebookLM is intended to fill scholarly and writing type use cases.</p>
<p>I am following the development of and trying out NotebookLM because the use cases Johnson describes align with my interests. Right now Google is focusing on input of content and there are no formal methods for producing output beyond copy and paste. I assume at some point in time Google will allow creation of documents in Google Docs.</p>
<p>Prior releases of NotebookLM allowed me to upload a small number of PDFs or Google Docs from Google Drive as sources, and the new update allows me to specify web sites. It does not crawl an entire domain, it appears to GET the HTML page for the URL you provide. I have found that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Winer&rsquo;s Old School CMS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that publishes my Daynotes structures the writing in a way that works well with NotebookLM.</p>
<p>As you can see from my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Monthly Index<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Old School creates a page for each month of the year for all of the posts published in that month, for example here are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all of the blog posts I wrote in February, 2024.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> To have NotebookLM use my Daynotes as the source for answers all I have to do is provide it the URL for each of the monthly pages. I am surprised that so far I haven&rsquo;t reached a limit to the number of web site URLs I can provide as sources because there is a limit in how many files (PDFs or Google Docs) one can provide.</p>
<p>I have entered all of the monthly URLs for 2021 through May, 2024 and then asked it to summarize what I wrote about in each year. You can save responses to the notebook, but sources are not included in what is saved, although you can get to them from the chat. When you click a source link from chat a pane opens with the source content that you can highlight and then save verbatim to the notebook or have Gemini summarize the highlighted content and save the summarization to a note.</p>
<p>One can copy and paste the content of a note, and I did that with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2022 Summary of my daynotes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, pasting it in to Drummer. I lightly edited the result in Drummer for formatting. My recommendation to Google would be to create the notes in markdown so that formatting will also carry over.</p>

			 <p>The author of this article, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->AI Alignment Is Trivial<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, is overlooking the lessons learned from the Internet. The real concern is not with the technology, but rather knowing our own flaws as humans. The author seems to be saying that we humans have control over the situation because all we have to do is not &ldquo;program&rdquo; AI with things like ambition. Unfortunately, we know there will be people who in fact will &ldquo;program&rdquo; AI to do these things in order achieve their own ambitions. All of technology, and AI in particular, is an amplification of humanity&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. One of our weaknesses is not knowing that there are things that even if we can do them, we should not do them. AI alignment is not trivial because human alignment is impossible.</p>

			 <p>In the Atlantic there is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->an article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (subscription required) that is an ode to the one-hand backhand, which is how I was taught to play tennis, but is rarely used today because tennis, like most sports, has devolved into all power.

All are examples, in an innocuous topic as sports, of how the ends now justify the means.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even an unguardable move such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s iconic “skyhook” would lose its luster in today’s money-balled NBA, where the statisticians have proved that the smartest way to play involves enormous quantities of three-point shots. There have perhaps never been more talented athletes and marksmen and less variety of gameplay. Everyone leverages the same generic (if often impressive) step-back three.</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781451419979">Naming the Powers</a> by Walter Wink 📚</p>
<p>I think this is a good book (series of books actually) for those who desire to follow Jesus to read at this time. The quote below is just one example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Weather Underground correctly criticized the U.S. government for its barbaric violence in Vietnam and then mirrored the very barbarism it condemned by adopting violence as its means. <strong>Whenever we let the terms of struggle be dictated by the Power that we oppose, we are certain to become as evil.</strong> Nothing about this insight is new. It is written for anyone to read in Rev. 17:15-18. There the Beast on whom the Harlot (Roma) sits turns against her and shifts his allegiance to the ten enemy kings. These will hate the harlot and burn her up with fire. The Beast can shift loyalties precisely because he knows that the means employed to overthrow the Harlot will make the kings every bit as much the children of hell as she. (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I assume that in the above Wink is referring to the Weather Underground as known as The Weathermen. The Weathermen emerged from the campus-based opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War and from the civil rights movement of the 1960s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground">Wikipedia</a></p>

			 <p>For those who wish to  use their vote to protest the U.S. participation in the genocide occurring in Gaza with their vote for President, I suggest you consider two things. First, if Trump is President rather than Biden would our participation be any different? Second, if Trump is President, which means Republicans rule, how likely do you think you can succeed at forcing change?  Finally, accept that for any person to be elected President in the United States they need to be a viable national candidate with a real chance to win the electoral college. The candidate must win states not just votes. I also think for change to really occur the Senate is what needs to change more than the President. No law passes in the United States without votes from 60 or more Senators. No person becomes Supreme Court Justice without votes from 60 or more Senators. Focus on the Senate. How do your state&rsquo;s Senators view Gaza?</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781101980972">Democracy in Chains</a> by Nancy MacLean 📚</p>
<p>Yesterday I read <a href="https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01hyx7pv8w8ymf17zknx87p6tk">an article</a> about James Buchanan that is inspired by this book, which I remembered I had in my Amazon library but not yet started reading. Consequently, I started reading and once again reminded of how the United States was founded.</p>
<p>The narrative taught when I was in school is that most people who immigrated to the new world did so to escape persecution, which was true for many people who came to the continent AFTER it was discovered. The motives behind the discovery of the continent was driven by wealth, whether through a shorter trade route to the east or the appropriation of land or gold.</p>
<p>Common folks who left Europe for a better life where not too much involved with the government or the decision to declare independence from England. The people who formed the United States did so to preserve their wealth, much of which starting to be generated from the plantations of the south.</p>
<p>Once the revolutionary war was over the people who sought independence had to decide how the new world was to be governed. Eventually what we know as the U.S. Constitution was drafted, but there was <a href="https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-resources/teacher-resources/infographic-differences-between-federalists-and-antifederalists">strong debate</a> over whether there should be a single entity and a strong federal government or a federation of sovereign states. Advocates of a federation, who became known as anti-federalists, were fearful of a central government impinging upon individual rights, which honestly had much to do with the right to become as wealthy was one wishes in whatever manner one wishes, including enslaving others.</p>
<p>History says a compromise was reached with the Bill of Rights and the Federalists won the day, but the Federalists/Anti-Federalist debate, which was about power, continues. It lead to the Civil War and it is the root of the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/dobbs_v._jackson_women%27s_health_organization_%282022%29#:~:text=of%20the%20fetus.-,Dobbs%20v.,people%20and%20their%20elected%20representatives.%E2%80%9D">Dobbs Decision</a>, and as this book chronicles, the Anti-Federalist cause has been systemically been carried out over the last five decades. I am convinced their success is in large part due to the profound lack of knowledge about history.</p>

			 <p>As I reflect upon <!-- raw HTML omitted -->what I wrote earlier today<!-- raw HTML omitted --> about Memorial Day, it occurs to me that my thoughts about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the meaning and purpose of this day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are consistent with how I was always taught. Memorial Day is a day of remembering those who died in service for our country, yes, and because of those sacrifices I enjoy freedom. What an individualistic point of view to think of how I benefited from the sacrifice others! What is lost in narrowing the view down to myself is seeing the good in the sacrifice.</p>
<p>We live in an extremely cynical world that teaches humanity only seeks personal advantage, that we are primarily driven by self-interest. The concept of sacrifice pushes against this cynicism. People who run into a burning building and sign up to serve in the military do not want to die but they understand the possibility and and do anyway because they are not driven by self-interest.</p>
<p>It is good to remember those who died in service to our country, and it is even better to remember why they died, which was less for our individual freedom and more for something beyond themselves, something good that they themselves would not enjoy. Cynicism and contempt of others is not the lesson of Memorial Day. Cynicism teaches us why there is evil, but in a such a worldview the far more interesting and important questions is, why is there any good?</p>

			 <p>On Memorial Day, when we remember the sacrifices of those who died serving our country during war, we ought to reflect on what it is that these people thought they died for.

			 <p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tariffs on imports<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from China first imposed by Trump and continued by Biden did not increase jobs in the U.S. but increased prices. While imports from China decreased they were simply replaced by imports from other countries. Assuming the purpose for the tariffs was to increase jobs in the U.S., it should be obvious this would happen because the tariffs don&rsquo;t address the root cause problem which is that corporations are not really interested in hiring more workers in the United States.  On the whole the United States is the last place a corporation wants to add labor because it has the highest cost. Imposing tariffs is simply pandering for votes.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I was mostly offline the last week as I on the road visiting family and friends. Catching up on my feeds, I see the reactions to the reviews of the new iPads that are predictable because they have been the same for the last five years or so now. All new iPad hardware is fantastic but hampered by the  operating system software. The real problem with these observations is that they are redundant and pointless unless one is reviewing a new release of iPad OS.</p>
<p>All technical reviews are opinion pieces. Ultimately, the author of the review is expressing an opinion about whether the product being reviewed is good or bad and whether the reader should buy the product or not, and I think it is the later point some people are reacting to.  Two types of readers/potential buyers exist, a small group of whom have never owned an iPad and another group that will considering upgrading from an older model to a new model.</p>
<p>The decision to upgrade is the tougher one because there are really few reasons to upgrade. The iPad Air I bought in 2020 runs everything I need it to run and will get the latest version of iPad OS when it is released. When I read in a review that iPad OS does not take full advantage of the hardware capability my simple translation is, it&rsquo;s not worth the money to upgrade. (Ironic side note, the iPad seems to be opposite of planned obsolescence and there seems to be a negative reaction, which makes me wonder whether we are too condition for planned obsolescence. )</p>
<p>Should a person who does not own an IPad buy the latest one? The answer to that question is easier, if they have a need or desire for an iPad they should buy whichever model they can afford. None of the reviews I have read even consider recommending their readers buy an Android, Chrome OS, or Windows (Surface) tablet because it is generally accepted that the iPad is best tablet on the market.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the reviews are really not reviews but instead editorials expressing ways in which Apple could improve the iPad or iPad OS. Editorials usually invite disagreement and so it is surprising when the authors of these articles are surprised by the disagreement as if they don&rsquo;t know they wrote an editorial rather than a review. If the same story is being written after every release of a new iPad, perhaps it&rsquo;s time for a different story.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dave Winer recently wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that we in the United States are already living in an authoritarian state. He cites as evidence the probability that SCOTUS will say the President of the United States is in fact above the law and notes that the Supreme Court has always been above the law. If one takes a honest look back at the history of the United States you will see that it has always been an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->oligarchy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> rather than a democracy.</p>
<p>The founders intended our government to be a republic, a representative democracy, rather than a pure democracy, that would prevent tyranny, but their intentions were thwarted as soon <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as political parties arose to control/influence our representatives<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Go back and look at the definition of oligarchy and consider whether political parties are nothing but classes of people who see the power of government vested in themselves.</p>
<p>Political parties are to democracy what monopolies are to capitalism, both corrupt the founding principles of their institutions, and those who enjoy the privileges of the power these oligarchies provide do everything they can to preserve those privileges.</p>
<p>Consider the wealth of the founding fathers, most of whom were white, male, property owners. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Washington<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jefferson<!-- raw HTML omitted --> owned plantations. When they wrote that all men were created equal, they assumed it understood that meant white, male, property owners and not others. The American Revolution was a war for white, male property owners to keep their wealth from the King of England.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Federalists vs Anti-Federalists debates<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Three-Fifths Compromise<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and associated <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electoral College<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Civil War<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Women&rsquo;s Suffrage<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim Crow Laws<!-- raw HTML omitted --> were all moments when the true nature of the founding of the Unites States was exposed.  What we are experiencing in the United States today is a continuation of how it has always been in the United States, the difference now is that the oligarchs have become so confident that they no longer care to continue pretending that there is actual democracy. The oligarchs have been able to convince a majority of the citizens of the United States that their aims align with the oligarchs, it is the realization of the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->trickle down<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; ideology that Ronald Reagan preached.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence has always hidden the prime question of civilization in plain sight.  When <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jefferson wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question is, liberty for whom?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Truth is, the norm of civilization on the Earth, which over time has been called different things but which can be simply stated as empire, has never allowed for liberty of everyone. Over the course of history different forms of government have existed and even those that claim to be democracies institute class hierarchies that provide liberty for some at the expense of others. Governments are institutions of humans and reflect our human dualistic view of the world. Governments are necessary and not particularly bad, but humans need to be self aware of our instincts and vigilant at guarding against them.</p>
<p>I believe the form of democracy in the United States as intended to exist through purpose, not the literal words, of the U.S. Constitution is as good a government that can provide liberty for everyone as any in the world, so long as citizens push back against our habit of seeing ourselves as better than and apart from our neighbor. I think such vigilance takes the form of placing core values above all others.</p>
<p>One such core value is what does liberty mean? You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look up the word liberty in a dictionary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and you will find several descriptions of what one may think of as freedom, but for me liberty boils down to my control over my body, which is exercised in many different ways such as to do as I please, to be free from restraint, and to decide what does and does not happen to my body.  A Supreme Court that is unwilling to recognize that liberty, which is intended to be enshrined by our founding documents, extends to women&rsquo;s right to decide what happens to their body is violating the core value of liberty.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights defines other core values, but perhaps one most overlooked but closely related to liberty is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Ninth Amendment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that states that it is the citizens who claim our rights and not only the Constitution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Constitution does not deny the rights retained by the people. Is a Supreme Court, or for that matter any member of Congress or President of the United States, that does not seem to know the definition of liberty or seeks to deny rights retained by the people acting in the best interests of the people as their representatives or are they acting in the best interests of their oligarch class?</p>
<p>It is true that the founders, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like Plato<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were not fond of pure democracy and thus created a republic as a representative form of democracy. The founders were also not fond of the authority of the monarchy they just fought a war against, and so they created a system of government intended to preserve the best features of democracy while preventing against  tyrannies be they of individuals or classes. Among but not limited to these features are the unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (Note the similarity between the Declaration and the Ninth Amendment) Beware of attempts to throw out democracy in the bathwater for that is language the political party oligarchs use to claim liberty for themselves at the expense of others. Let us be vigilant for that more perfect union that Madison wrote in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Preamble of the U.S. Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

			 <p>I am beginning to think that while much focus is on the upcoming Presidential election what may be more important is Democrat majorities in the Senate and House. Only a single party majority of both houses makes impeachment a real power over the President.

			 <p>In my opinion the Presidential Immunity case before the Supreme Court could be the most consequential to the future of the United States of any case in my life time. The case raises the question of whether Richard Nixon was right in his claims that a President of the United States can never go before the court, that they are not really bound by the rule of law. Had Gerald Ford not given Nixon a pardon it is likely that the Supreme Court in that day would have heard a case similar to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the one before them now for Trump<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I can see a Supreme Court of justices who claim to be originalists proclaim that the President is above the law because the U.S. Constitution has holes as it is made of words. When fundamentalists only look for words and ignore meaning or intent that enables them to promote an ideology. The originalist ideology seems intent on returning us to  past centuries in which white men held all the power and for which liberty only applied.</p>
<p>If the United States is a nation based on the rule of law, and the Supreme Court says that rule of law does not apply to the President, how can the republic remain based on the rule of law?</p>

			 <p>Dave Winer is putting much effort into rebooting <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogrolls<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which traditionally are a list of other blog sites shown on the right side of a main blog page. Back when blogging was more social than commercial blogrolls where a method of helping readers to find other blogs to read.  You might recognize how on the right side of many blogs there are lists like Recent Posts and Archives such as on one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my WordPress sites<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the placement of a blogroll is consistent with that layout.</p>
<p>When I compare the layout of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my WordPress site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Daynotes site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the column to the right in WordPress appears to be a part of the page whereas the blogroll on the Daynotes page is obviously a different part. It&rsquo;s a nit I know, but I prefer how it looks in WordPress when I compare the two.</p>
<p>Shortly after Dave began posting about his work, Manton <!-- raw HTML omitted -->added blogroll support<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->micro.blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, albeit with some differences. The blogroll support in micro.blog, which is being called Recommendations, is not connected to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which means the list of blog sites is stored and maintained separately and that is unfortunate. You can import an OPML file of the sites to micro.blog, but then have to maintain the items in micro.blog rather than in Feedland.  One can delete and re-create a Recommendation, however.</p>
<p>Another difference is that micro.blog produces a static list, which is consistent with how blogrolls originally function, but doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of Dave&rsquo;s latest work that shows which of the sites have new posts to read. On the other hand, the links to the sites in the list is much more obvious to the reader than with the blogroll widget that Dave created. Compare the list on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Daynotes page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogroll page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have created here. On the Daynotes page I can tell which blog has been recently updated, then a user has to click to expand to see the entries of the site and then know to click the date/time to the right of an entry to read the item. On the blogroll page all you see is the hyperlink to the site, which is more obvious to a reader, but one then has to go to each site to discover and read new entries. Tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The blogroll of my main blog is part of a page of the site that the reader needs to navigate to, which is due to my choice of template rather than a limitation of micro.blog. Manton&rsquo;s blog shows the list of Recommended Blogs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on its main page.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I am personally torn on which is better because I like having just my writing appearing on the blog pages rather than the right side items you see on some sites. On the other hand, if the blogroll is not on the main page what is the probability that a reader will ever see it? I guess this begs the question, do readers actually click through to any of the sites on the blogroll?</p>

			 <p>Yesterday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GM announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it is moving its headquarters from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Renaissance Center<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the new Hudson building next year. The announcement has me feeling sad.  I moved to the Detroit area in 1989 to start my career with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electronic Data Systems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (EDS), which then was a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors. I could have worked at any one of dozens of offices in the Detroit area that EDS or GM occupied, but my job was located at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the General Motors Building<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, now known as Cadillac Place, a beautiful building designed by architect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albert Kahn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and constructed in the early 1920s. Every work day for two years I walked through the architectural marvels that are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fisher<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and GM Buildings.</p>
<p>In 1995 GM spun off EDS into an independent company and to complete that spin off EDS paid GM $500 million. A year later GM announced it was buying the Renaissance Center for $73 million and moving their headquarters to that building. I remember watching the announcement GM made to their employees that featured an animation of a helicopter placing the GM logo on the top of the RenCen tower. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six  years later EDS announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it was consolidating some of its Detroit offices, all used in support of GM, into Tower 500 of the Renaissance Center, and a few years after that I moved into a brand new cube in the newly renovated tower.</p>
<p>Detroit today looks very different than it did back in 1996, back then the Detroit riverfront as mostly discarded properly with piles of dirt or dirt parking lots. Today a beautiful walking path stretches from Belle Isle south by about five miles, connecting a few new parks along the way. The difference one sees in Detroit today can be traced back to GM&rsquo;s purchase of the Renaissance Center and the millions of dollars it spent to revitalize the riverfront area. I am certain that without the investment that GM made Dan Gilbert would not have been as interested to make the investments in Detroit that lead to the new tower on the Hudson site.</p>
<p>I very much enjoyed my years working at the Renaissance Center, although the commute that could stretch for more than an hour if there were an accident, not so much. Whenever there was an event, like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Super Bowl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Bull air races<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or when there were parades for the Detroit Red Wings or Pistons championships, the RenCen was energetic.</p>
<p>The announcement yesterday did not include any information about the future of the RenCen. While GM and its subsidiaries occupied nearly the whole of all four office towers, that began to decrease over time either through head count reductions or by GM&rsquo;s sale/spinoff of GMAC/Ally Finanicial that moved to another office building in Detroit. During my time working at the RenCen EDS went from occupying all 13 floors of Tower 500 to slowing emptying out floors of that building and ultimately ending up in two floors of Tower 100, and at that time EDS was again acquired, this time by Hewlett Packard. We eventually moved from the Renaissance Center to an entire office building in Pontiac until 2018 when the landlord of that build sold it and the now DXC Technology moved to two floors in building in Auburn Hills.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine the Renaissance Center being torn down because it is so iconic, but at the same time it is hard to imagine that much office space being occupied. Perhaps the center (tallest) tower can be renovated into a mix of hotel and loft/condos, but it is hard to imagine all four towers being occupied in such a manner. During the announcement yesterday it was said that GM, the city of Detroit, Wayne County, and Bedrock (Gilbert&rsquo;s company) will be working together to plan the future for the site. I will not be surprised if the four office towers are torn down with the tallest middle one remaining to make room for some new development.</p>

			 <p>I watched an introduction to AI video yesterday in which the presenter went to great lengths to try and convince me that AI is really ok and we really don&rsquo;t have anything to worry about. The problem I have with AI is that I have lived through the birth and growth of the Internet and through that I&rsquo;ve learned that software is just an amplification of humanity. As long as there are humans who see other humans as nothing more than a means to the ends of their wealth we have much to fear about any software that amplifies human failings.</p>

			 <p>Good morning Cubs fans! Welcome to Eclipse day. Our Cubbies have played three series and won two of them. We could have won all three of them if you consider how well Justin Steele was pitching before his injury in Texas. So far the lineup as produced runs and the starting pitching has been pretty good. My only disappointment yesterday is that the rain disrupted Imanga&rsquo;s start against the Dodgers, which I was looking forward to seeing. Hopefully they continue to play well during the road trip this week along the west coast.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t think it controversial to say that much of what ills the government of the United States is caused by money. What may be controversial is that I do not think giving money is an expression of free speech, rather I think the act of giving money is an emolument. Limiting the amount of money a corporation, committee, or individual gives to an elected official is not an infringement on free speech. Common sense tells us this and yet in 1990 SCOTUS in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said otherwise. In order to make a more perfect union, as Madison wrote in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the preamble to the Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I think we need clear definition that giving of money to elected officials in our republic is an emolument rather than an express of free speech.</p>
<p>The difference between money and speech lies in how much the person receiving either needs what is offered. Today elected officials, particularly federal officials, need a lot of money. The amounts of money needed by a person to be elected to office makes it something more than speech because it enables a smaller number of people to influence the person elected. One&rsquo;s need of money and the receipt of that money is a quid pro quo; the giver of the money expects something in return and that expectation makes the giving of money an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->emolument<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Federalist 39<!-- raw HTML omitted --> James Madison wrote, &ldquo;If we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established, we may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior. It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The founders knew how emoluments could lead to corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because they lived in a time when it was common practice for foreign countries to gain favor from monarchs by gift giving. Emoluments are not given as an act of generosity, they are given with the expectation of something in return. If you think about it, you could say that emoluments, the giving of gifts of large sums of money, is simply capitalism at work, and here in lies the circumstances we find ourselves in today.</p>
<p>We in the United States, so accustomed to our highly capitalistic society, have become numb to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->corrosive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nature of money and thus think little of emoluments. If we were to write the Constitution today we might not even include emolument clauses in it because they have become such a part of everyday life. The other side of that coin, however, is that everyone in our capitalistic society knows full well that when one person or one committee or one corporation writes a check for thousands, hundreds of thousands or more dollars to a politician it is done with the expectation of something in return. Enough money from a small group of people gains more influence than a citizen could ever hope to gain through exercising their right to free speech. Isn&rsquo;t this how elected officials pretty much ignore what their constituents say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is it that emoluments from &ldquo;any King, Prince, or foreign State&rdquo; is worse than emoluments from citizens, corporations, or Political Action Committees?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, like many things, many tend to take a literal view of corruption and emoluments. Huge election donations and lobbying come with expectations that effectively buy votes, but we don&rsquo;t think of this as corruption, at least not legally. However, I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can deny that huge part of our lack of trust in the institutions of government, or media (journalism), or medicine, is due in large part to an awareness of how much influence on decisions is being bought. The growing lack of trust in government is the corrosion (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) of the Republic in plain sight. (Further, if you think about it, much of the lack of trust in Biden or Trump is due to money!)</p>
<p>The founders of the United States knew full well the affect emoluments can have on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->republic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is why they included <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clauses in the Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to limit that affect. Unfortunately, the ideology of originalism says that literal words, not the meaning or intent, only matters. (Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism can mean that Supreme Court Justices could be replaced by AI.)  Originalists will say, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 only has the words &ldquo;from any King, Prince, or foreign State&rdquo; and there is no such prohibition of emoluments given from citizens of the United States, even if the very thing that clause was intended to prevent, which is the corruption of the government through quid pro quo, is what is happening.</p>
