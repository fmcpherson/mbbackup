			 <p>As of this morning the Chicago Cubs are 3 games behind the Milwaukee Brewers for the N.L. Central lead and have a 2 game lead in the N.L. Wildcard. Nearly all MLB teams are not playing today. On Friday (September 1) the Cubs will have a chance to gain more ground on the Brewers by virtue of a double header, whereas the Brewers play the Phillies. The double header is in Cincinnati and the Reds are chasing the Cubs for the Wildcard, so both teams have playoff positions to play for and therefore the games will be tense.</p>

			 <p>I wonder, how much of inflation is caused by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-tariff-foreign-imports-trade-policy/675169/">Trump&rsquo;s tariffs</a>? One of the arguments that any opponent to Trump should make is that there is a difference between feeling better and actually being better, and the tariffs are a perfect example. When Trump announces a tariff his supporters feel better, he is sticking it to &ldquo;the Chinese!&rdquo; But, what they don&rsquo;t realize is the relationship between the tariffs and increased prices because the tariffs only work if there is sufficient manufacturing in the United States. The tariffs have to come AFTER increases in manufacturing in the United States, not before, in order for them to be protecting anything.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/08/29/time-for-the.html">Time For The Chicago Cubs To Embrace The Pressure</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The 162 game schedule is a big part of what makes Major League Baseball unique among professional sports in the United States because it tends to force differences in how games are approached throughout the season. No team is ever going to be undefeated, the current best team, the Atlanta Braves, has won a little over 65% of their games. The MLB season is a marathon meaning that in most cases a game is not treated as &ldquo;must win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oddly, while a long schedule means most games are not &ldquo;must win,&rdquo; for some teams, earlier than they would like, the season transitions to &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they win or lose&rdquo; because they are out of playoff contention. As a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan it has been my experience more often than not that the Cubs are out of playoff contention by the end of May or early June. Further, as a lifelong Cubs fan, I have learned it is much more fun watching games year after year when the team is playing meaningful games in September. I would much rather have the team lose in the playoffs every year than have the team out the playoffs by June in the majority of seasons.</p>

<p>So, in baseball, a transition occurs over the course of a season where teams move from playing to win games to playing to must win games. The benefit of expanding the number of playoff teams is that more teams start playing more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games in September than in years past. In my experience, teams with players who have the most experience winning &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games are best positioned for long term success.</p>

<p>As an aside, it should be obvious why wild card teams, which have worse records than division winners, have had so much success in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s because they usually play more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games during the last month of the season and through that gain valuable experience and confidence. Turns out there is a big difference between &ldquo;wanting to win&rdquo; and &ldquo;needing to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point of a long 2023 season, the Chicago Cubs are starting the transition in to &ldquo;must win&rdquo; territory. Nobody associated with the Cubs is going to admit publicly that the games they are playing this week and next are must win, but it&rsquo;s a mistake if they don&rsquo;t start viewing the games as such, in fact they ought to embrace the transition. As Billy Jean King is often <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/quote/621788">quoted as saying</a>, &ldquo;Pressure is a privilege.&rdquo; The pressure of being in &ldquo;must win&rdquo; mode as the calendar flips from August to September is a badge of success.</p>

<p>The unpredictable nature of sports mean should the Cubs make the playoffs they could win the World Series. The probability of the 2023 Cubs winning the World Series is not high, not like it was for the 2016 team. However, the experience of playing as many &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games as possible over the course of the final month of the season is huge! The Cubs are exactly where they hoped to be at this time of the season and now players who have not had the experience with this type of pressure gain the experience that will provide dividends for years beyond.</p>

<p>I was mad the Cubs were crushed by the Brewers last night because I desire the immediate gratification of winning the N.L. Central this year, but I am happy that the young Cubs players such as their current best starting pitcher, Justin Steele, are getting this experience playing these games. However, the full value of that experience will not be realized if the team, from top to bottom, doesn&rsquo;t consider these games &ldquo;must win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The 2023 MLB Season is transitioning from &ldquo;would like to win&rdquo; to &ldquo;must win&rdquo; for the Cubs, and I am looking for the team to embrace the pressure.</p>

I use a variety of different apps for writing notes all of which at the end of the day mainly serve for storing information. None of these apps enable me to be smarter, but they enable me to recall information when (or if) I need it. The article doesn&rsquo;t get in much detail, but I agree with the suggestion that AI based on the information stored in note taking apps like Roam Research may be fusion needed, but still requires one to learn how to ask good questions.</p>

			 <p>The Chicago Cubs are playing the Detroit Tigers in Detroit this week, and I went to the Monday and Tuesday night games.  The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/cubs-vs-tigers/2023/08/21/716913/final/wrap">Cubs won 7-6 Monday night</a> in a game when the Cubs gained and gave up a four run lead but hung on to win.  The <a href="https://www.mlb.com/gameday/cubs-vs-tigers/2023/08/22/716896/final/wrap">Tigers won Tuesday night 8-6</a>, but the Cubs had a 4-3 run lead after the top of the fourth inning and then gave up 4 runs to the Tigers in the bottom of the inning. The Cubs scored 2 runs in the top of the fifth inning to pull within one run, but scored no more while the Tigers added an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth inning. As of today the Cubs record is 65-60 and they are 3.5 games behind the Brewers in the NL Central division and have the second wild card for the NL playoffs.</p>

<p>Highlights of the games include seeing <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HtvAduMMyr9wGztF7">Cody Bellinger</a>, former NL  MVP, playing for the Cubs, he will likely not re-sign with the Cubs at the end of the season. Future <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6UVt4SFqXUHWUkZF8">Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera</a> was the DH for the Tigers in Tuesday&rsquo;s game, possibly his last game ever against the Chicago Cubs. Click to see the pictures I took during the games on <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vzeZnYyNT2vAxSfz9">Monday</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ebGhe6SQyiZ5Qfzn6">Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/08/22/in-the-upper.html">I captured a foul ball</a> during the game on Tuesday. It was fumbled by the guy in front of me and I grabbed after it landed on the steps next to me.</p>

			 <p>I agree with most of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/us-culture-moral-education-formation/674765/">what David Brooks writes here</a>, but I do think he is missing some context. The main societal change of my life time has been the rise of conservatism, mainly via the Reagan presidency, but you can probably trace that back further to post World War II and the establishment of the U.S. political and capitalistic empire. The political empire demands the United States stands alone as the most powerful nation on earth, the capitalistic empire demands that citizens are responsible for themselves so that there is no redistribution of wealth.</p>

Today will be a test to see whether the Cubs can beat a better team in a series. Given how this is playing out, I think the experience of playing meaningful games through September is going to be huge for the near future Cub teams. Even if they lose Stroman and Bellinger during the offseason this experience for the maturity of the team is with every penny spent.</p>

<p>To figure out how to get the country past its current impasse, we need to look at reality as it is, not as we imagine it might be. And the reality is that our deep political divide is rooted, first and foremost, in profound and largely irreconcilable views of who America is for and what its social hierarchy should look like. That may be unpleasant for Brooks — and all of us — to contemplate, but reality’s ugliness doesn’t provide an excuse for ignoring it.</p>

			 <p>I am seeing lots of articles about the demise of the PAC-12 college conference. To an older guy such as myself I find the current conference names no longer make sense. Granted, the Big Ten doesn&rsquo;t explicitly name a region but it has been for Midwest colleges all my life, west coast colleges mess that up. So, I say you might as well just change the conference names.</p>

<p>One thing I do wonder, with the PAC-12 disbanded what of the Rose Bowl? While the CFB championship long ago broke the Big Ten/PAC-12 match ups, they did try to hold to that when not hosting  the championship. Now what?</p>

The Cubs extended Happ this year and honestly have not missed Contreras. Further, it seems the new cornerstone of the Cubs is Nico Hoerner and Dansby Swanson. Better yet, the Cubs bought at this trade deadline and their playoff chances are very much alive.</p>

They have the hitting to put up a huge number of runs and the pitching to enable them to win, but as prone they are to score 20 runs in one night, today they might score only 2. Too many losing streaks up to this season has prevented them from being in first place right now. Good new is that they have more games against the Brewers and Reds that enable them to close the gap. Every series for the remainder of the season is must win.</p>

			 <p>The Chicago Cubs winning streak ended at eight games today with a loss to the Cardinals in the last game of the season against their division rival.

Obviously, the streak had to end eventually, but the Cards have proven to be very beatable and we had every reason to expect the Cubs to win today too. Tomorrow night the Cubs start a four game series against the Reds at home, and they need to win the first game as they can no longer afford losing streaks. Even more importantly, the Cubs are 3.5 games behind the Reds in the NL Central standings and we do not want to fall further behind. The Cubs have an opportunity to pull closer to the Reds and Brewers this week and therefore solidify being in the hunt for the remainder of the season. Losing 3 out of 4 of these games against the Reds might actually be too difficult to overcome. Ross needs to be putting the best lineup in every game for this series, I do not want to see Mancini at first and Morel in place other than DH. Play Gomes in all of these games. Cubs need to treat this series like the playoffs!</p>

			 <p>The Chicago Cubs beat St. Louis last night and evened their record to 51-51, and sit at 5.5 games behind first place in the NL Central and 4 games back in the Wild Card. In short, a better record and potential than last year. <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2022/07/28/much-talk-regarding.html">The sell off really didn&rsquo;t happen last year</a>, but this year there is much debate about what they should do with Cody Bellinger and Marcus Stroman, both who are really good but with whom the Cubs lose contract control at the end of the season. I think the Cubs&rsquo; chances to make the playoffs this year are real, and at a minimum ownership owes the fans a competitive team for the remainder of the season. I say they should keep both Bellinger and Stroman and make serious intent to sign them at the end of the season. The farm system is not in dire need of prospects.</p>

			 <p>Danah Boyd&rsquo;s take on the emergent Twitter alternatives is <a href="https://zephoria.medium.com/dear-alt-twitter-designers-its-about-the-network-3d6f7e8714dd">worth the read</a>. I think a point not made is whether the emergent service is driven to dominate the world or satisfied to meet a niche. Case in point is micro.blog, which appears to aspire to nothing more than nurturing a relatively small community and yet I assume it generates enough revenue to cover costs and provides enough income for it&rsquo;s employees. The ideas of &ldquo;enough&rdquo; and &ldquo;nurturing&rdquo; are what is missing behind nearly all of the alternatives except for perhaps Mastodon, which appears to be dedicated to nurturing an open source alternative.</p>

			 <p>Last month <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/06/28/smokey-eye-not.html">I wrote</a> about impact the wildfires in Canada had on the air quality at my home. Last week there was another occurrence in which the air patterns changed to bring the smoke pollution back toward us and this time I had in place an indoor <a href="https://www.airthings.com/view-pollution">Airthings Pollution Monitor</a> that provides PM2.5 readings. What I saw is that the outdoor smoke pollution definitely affects the quality of the air in the second floor of our condo, and therefore I think the monitor can provide indication that the outdoor pollution is worse. We didn&rsquo;t have the windows open and it wasn&rsquo;t so hot outside to cause our central air conditioning to run more than normal, but obviously the house is not hermetically sealed and we did open doors to go outside. What I don&rsquo;t know is what to do when the air gets bad? I am thinking get more internal air circulation, either with floor fans or the fan in our HVAC or buy air purifiers.</p>

Ideally, I take four walks each day, one after each meal and an extra in the afternoon. The time and distance I walk is dictated by my schedule and the weather.

			 <p>I am resigned to the fact that Chicago Cubs are not going to be a playoff team this year, which makes them sellers for the upcoming trade deadline, and it is this idea of &ldquo;selling&rdquo; that makes me mad. We knew that Cody Bellinger was only going to be with the Cubs for a year and if he played to any amount of his capability would be a mid season trade, so his leaving is not a problem. What I don&rsquo;t want to see is the Cubs trading Marcus Stroman.</p>

<p>Starting pitching is the foundation of a MLB team and the Cubs have no real pitching prospects in their farm system. Every free agent pitcher not on their team that the Cubs sign is an unknown. Jameson Taillon is the most recent case in point, the Cubs didn&rsquo;t really know what they were getting when they signed Taillon but they hoped he would be as good as he was in previous seasons. <b>When you sign a player not on your team you hope they will perform as you expect, but hope is not a strategy! </b></p>

<p>Stroman has been the best Cubs pitcher the last two years. You can make the claim he is one of the best pitchers in baseball and the Cubs should know best about his health, his mental make up, and his skills. In other words, Stroman is a known asset, and when you are building a team I think <b>general managers should bias what they know about the players on their team</b>.</p>

<p>If the Cubs trade Stroman, to me that not only means this season (2023) is down the drain, it is also that they are not closer to making the playoffs in 2024. What such a trade tells me is that the Cubs continue to tread mediocrity and have no real plan for returning to the playoffs. Further, if the Cubs trade Stroman and thus are sellers at the deadline ownership must make a change in the front office and the manager. I don&rsquo;t think Hoyer has any real idea how to build the team, he is just hoping to improve, and <b>hope is not a plan.</b></p>

<p>The &ldquo;buyers and sellers&rdquo; phenomenon is not good for Major League Baseball. The way teams treat free agency is destroying how they build their teams and farm systems for continued success. Now, because most teams in baseball are not very good, most teams are unloading their best players mid season for prospects that might never make it to the majors or at best won&rsquo;t be on their team until 3 years down the road. Every off season teams buy a bunch of free agents (basically creating new rosters every year), all who are unknowns, and hope they perform well enough to form a competitive team. Most teams find their hopes were ill conceived and they rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Put it another way, <b>nearly all MLB general managers are doing their job no differently than fantasy baseball managers</b>. Problem is, fantasy baseball is not the real world. MLB does not build rosters based on a draft of the entire pool of available players. <b>Right now the Cubs, and most MLB teams, are building new rosters each year from a small pool of unknowns</b>. I am looking for leadership from the Cubs with a real plan and the funding from ownership to stick to the plan. It is looking more to me that Hoyer does not have a real plan and Ricketts has to find another person to run team who has a plan, otherwise he is no better than all prior owners of the Chicago Cubs.</p>

National emergencies like a pandemic that can, and did, result in the deaths of millions of people, should not be used for political gain or handled to minimize political risk. At a time like this the President of the United states has to stop being a politician and govern in a manner that treats all citizens of all political party affiliations the same way. Trump always analyzed very single aspect of COVID-19 through the lens of how it hurts or helps him politically. COVID-19 killed Republicans and Democrats equally. <b>The very investigations going on right now about COVID-19 are still politically motivated, and that is the real problem!</b></p>

Constantine, not Jesus, founded the Christian religion of what nearly every person who claims the identity, Jesus on the other hand started something very different. Oh, and by the way, the first amendment is more about preventing government from using religion to enforce tyranny than it is about allowing people to discriminate on religious grounds.

			 <p>I am a life long Chicago Cubs fan, and so that gives me the perspective of comparing the current Cubs teams to those of the past. The 2023 edition of the Chicago Cubs is frustrating because there is so much <a href="https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2023/7/1/23780818/2023-cubs-heroes-and-goats-game-80">talent on the team that is not living up to its potential</a>, and the result is very inconsistent play. Simply put, the Cubs lose too many games in a row. Really good teams don&rsquo;t lose more than two games in a row, whereas the Cubs often fall in to a streak of losing 3 or more games in a row, the result is an attempt to move up in standings is like being in quick sand.</p>

The biggest influence I see on VOC in our house is the furnace and air conditioning and the good thing is that the AC was not running as much as it could so the VOC number has stayed in the good range. VOC is not the same as Particulate Matter pollution caused by the wildfires and currently affecting the outdoor air quality, I would need <a href="https://www.airthings.com/view-pollution">a different sensor</a> for that reading.</p>

			 <p>I have an account on Bluesky: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/frankm.bsky.social">@frankm.bsky.social</a>. It looks and feels like Twitter. In summary, I question whether the world really needs more social networks. My daily check-ins are to micro.blog, Facebook, and Instagram. I will classify Instagram as my guilty pleasure, I check Facebook because that is where my friends are, and micro.blog is the only real social network I go to for networking with others. I read a lot of <a href="http://river.frankm.info:1337/">what is made visible to me via RSS</a>, and I write my thoughts in this blog and my <a href="http://daynotes.frankm.info">Daynotes</a>, and here in summation is my use of the Internet.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23773112/google-pixel-fold-vs-samsung-z-fold-4-comparison-head-to-head-foldable-phones">Dan Seifert writing for The Verge</a> provides an interesting comparison between the Samsung Z Fold and the Pixel Fold. Samsung&rsquo;s foldable is optimized for portrait orientation while the Pixel Fold is oriented around landscape. I note that the Surface Duo has a similar design perspective, and the consequence is better single screen, phone-like usage. Seifert&rsquo;s opinion is that one buys a foldable for the inside screen thus Samsung&rsquo;s approach may be better. I agree that portrait is right for small screen tablets, but I understand Google&rsquo;s approach to making sure there is a good phone experience. What I wonder is, how does the Kindle app look in portrait on the Pixel Fold?</p>

The reviews that I have read so far are biased by the cost of the phone, the gist being that it&rsquo;s not good enough for the price. Given the $1,800 price, I wonder whether it could ever be good enough at that price? In my opinion this is the consequence of a company releasing an expensive first generation device, the price does not allow any grace for the fact that it is first generation.</p>

I did not expect the Cardinals to go 13 below .500 and sit in the cellar looking up at the Cubs. Shows the importance of playing the game. The Cubs need to at least split in London, but really should sweep.</p>

			 <p>Lately I have been ruminating on generational differences in relationship to technology. Like all things, technology changes over time. I remember a time before cell phones, when the only way to make a phone call was to by using a handset in our home, but I don&rsquo;t remember a time when there were no phones. Generations younger than mine do not know of a time when cell phones did not exist. Today <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/06/22/220621.html">Dave Winer writes</a> of a similar technology change, between black and white and color television.</p>

<p>The differences between those who lived during &ldquo;before and after&rdquo; periods and &ldquo;never knew anything else&rdquo; periods of technology can have significant societal consequences. I think the Internet is one such case, with those who have never lived without the Internet expecting all matters related to time happening much faster than my generation and older who grew up without the Internet. The &ldquo;Internet&rdquo; generation will not tolerate society changes needing to take tens or hundreds of years of time (civil rights, women&rsquo;s rights, gay rights, etc..) to complete, they expect such change to happen in months if not days!</p>

			 <p>I spend every work day in my home office that is located in the basement of our house, which can be 2 to 5 degrees cooler than the main floor, therefore I usually wear sweats rather than shorts. I also try to take four walks during the day, usually after each meal. When I walk I carry my phone and house key. I recently switched to the Pixel 7a that is heavier than the Pixel 4a I used previously, and I find it too heavy to carry comfortably in the pocket of my sweats. Consequently, I&rsquo;ve started to carry the phone and keys in <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/collections/slings/products/marqui-crossbody-pouch">a sling pouch</a> that I am wearing while on my walk but it is a tad larger than I prefer, so I have ordered <a href="https://alpakagear.com/collections/pouches-wallets/products/modular-phone-sling">a smaller phone sling from Alpaka</a> that I hope will be better to wear on my walks.</p>

			 <p>After reading <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/what-rfk-jr-gets-rightand-what-he">this article about RFK Jr.</a> and his candidacy for President, it occurs to me that what should be most important is how a person works and interacts with those with whom they disagree. It seems most people believe that a President can and should be able to simply make changes and that would make that person a king against which we declared our independence. Consequently, any person in power is going to encounter oppositional power and how that person handles it is an important skill. So, RFK Jr. has some opinions about affects of vaccines on autism, which he is certainly allowed to have, but what will he do with them? How does he view those who disagree with his opinions, with contempt or as an opponent? Too many people treat others with contempt and that is counter productive.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s the first official day of summer, which means we are now at peak amount of daylight for the year. According to an app I have that is 15 hours and 18 minutes of daylight where I live in southeast Michigan. Sunset here is 9:15 PM. During my college years I lived in Houghton, Michigan during two summers. Houghton is also in the eastern time zone but if you <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=map+of+the+upper+peninsula+michigan&oq=map+of+the+upp&aqs=chrome.1.0i512l2j69i57j0i512l7.4837188301j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#">look for it on a map</a> you will find it north of Wisconsin and if you draw a straight line down from it you will end up at the middle of Wisconsin. Why that matters is that Wisconsin is in the central time zone. Sunset in Houghton is at 9:54 PM tonight, which means dusk extends well past 10 PM, making for much longer evenings with daylight than anywhere else I have ever lived.</p>

			 <p>The blog post titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/how-technology-has-changed-the-world">How technology has changed the world since I was young</a>&rdquo; by <a href="https://substack.com/@noahpinion">Noah Smith</a> lacks a very significant impact of the Internet on the world, which is our expectation of and thus perception on time. People who never lived in a time before the Internet have no concept of not knowing what is happening in the world in near real time. Such people have never lived in a time when it was not possible to buy something and have it delivered the next day&hellip; and in many cases that day! Consequently, such people expect change to happen much faster than those of us who lived before the Internet. I think the source of much tension in our society today is the battle between those who expect immediate change and those who are used to change taking years if not decades. Every battle over rights in the United States comes down to those demanding immediate change and those who either don&rsquo;t want change or want to at least slow down change.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday the Chicago Cubs swept the NL Central leading Pittsburgh Pirates. The Cubs are currently 3.5 games behind the Pirates with a 31-37 record, the Pirates record is 34-33. The strategy for the NL Central should be to maintain at least a .500 record and you will have a chance to win the division come September, and based on that the Cubs being 6 games below .500 is a concern, but plenty of time to make it up as long as they keep winning series. Unfortunately, today the Cubs start a series against the Baltimore Orioles who are a better team with a 43-25 record. If the Cubs can win this series, they then travel to Pittsburgh for another three game series and an opportunity to make up ground. It&rsquo;s not too early to emphasize the importance of winning a series, and I think this one with the Orioles is an important one.</p>

I just returned from a trip and I would love to be able to upload pictures that I took during the trip to a separate page that I can just link to rather than post all the pictures to the main blog page. What I desire is to batch upload a bunch of photos, be prompted for a date and place and have the software automatically make a photo page. The only photos plug-ins involve changes to the &ldquo;default&rdquo; photos page or converting a blog to something like Instagram.</p>

<p>I am not very sophisticated in managing my photos, they upload automatically to Google Photos and I use Syncthing to make a local backup. I can, and do, make albums in Google Photos, which used to be made automatically but no longer do.</p>

			 <p>Is it me, or does some hotel cancellation policies feel like a scam? What I am seeing is to be able to cancel as late as 24 hours before some hotels are charging $50 or more a night. Some times it’s worse. I made a reservation at a hotel a few weeks back that only allows free cancellation up until a week before the check in date, no matter the price, and that just seems wrong. I wanted to pay less per night in comparison to other hotels, so I made the reservation with the sinking feeling Murphy would get me, and he did as I had to cancel today, which is check in day and that would have cost me the same cancellation fee if I cancelled two days ago.</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel that the “inflation news” has given all businesses liberty to find all sorts of ways to make more money</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Google announced and began selling <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7a?hl=en-US">the Pixel 7a</a> earlier last month, and I ordered a Sea colored version from Amazon about a week later. The Pixel 7a is replacing the Pixel 4a that has been my everyday carry phone for the last three years. I really like the size and feel of the Pixel 4a and so I was not eager to up-size to the newer phone, but it has come to the end of the road with Android and there are features the 7a has that make the upgrade a &ldquo;no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My main concern about the Pixel 7a has been its size and glossy back. The Pixel 7a is taller than the Pixel 4a and because of that I find it harder to operate with one hand. The weight, however, is the most noticeable difference. I am finding that due to the weight it is more comfortable holding the phone in my left hand, but in a position where I can&rsquo;t scroll apps with that same hand and as a result this phone requires more two hand operation than the Pixel 4a. The weight and size difference is also noticeable when I put the Pixel 7a in a front pant pocket. Fortunately, the size do not make these use cases impossible, just different and I suspect the difference will become less noticeable over time.</p>

<p>The back of the Pixel 7a is more &ldquo;polished&rdquo; than the Pixel 4a, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel so slippery that I fear it is going to quickly slip out of my hand. I purchased a <a href="https://latercase.com/products/google-pixel-7a-thin-case?variant=40235135729750">really nice Latercase</a> that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone.</p>

<p>Battery life appears to be better, but I don&rsquo;t know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. <a href="https://accubatteryapp.com/">Accubattery</a> is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%. Battery life is an item that requires a longer duration to evaluate.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is just me, but I think pictures using the wide angle lens have a bit of a fish eye affect. (See the last picture on <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/20/testing-the-camera.html">this page</a> for an example.) I don&rsquo;t think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras.</p>

<p>I really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast.</p>

<p>As I expected, it was a real pain to move the Pixel Watch from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/21/googles-tech-ecosystem.html">Google really does not understand what is a technology ecosystem</a>, it&rsquo;s not just a suite of products that have the same appearance, it&rsquo;s products that work together with little effort by the user. The fact that one has to factory reset a WearOS watch to move it from one Pixel phone to another is the clearest evidence of Google&rsquo;s cluelessness when it comes to tech ecosystems. At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work.</p>

<p>Of the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it&rsquo;s best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery. Seems to me though that Google intends users to keep the phone on the stand, so you would think they would incorporate programming to help with the battery health.</p>

<p>Over all I am happy with the Pixel 7a. It&rsquo;s larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the &ldquo;A Series&rdquo; pixel phones, but it&rsquo;s not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the &ldquo;small, medium, and large&rdquo; sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phone is to get a larger screen. I really hope that Google keeps a phone that is no larger than 6-inches tall.</p>

			 <p>I am watching the IndyCar practice of <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/sports/2023-detroit-grand-prix-everything-you-need-to-know">the Detroit Grand Prix</a>, which is racing around the Renaissance Center where I worked for nearly nine years. At one time or another I&rsquo;ve driven parts <a href="https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/774c807/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1309+0+0/resize/1280x698!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdd%2Fb9%2F2fce05ea443bbe61382c4c0eaacd%2Ftrack-map-large-20230501.jpeg">the entire circuit</a>, and I made turns 4, 5, 6, and 7 nearly every week day. I am seeing them going 70 mph on stretches I wouldn&rsquo;t dare drive more than 30. The pits are in a parking lot where I used to park when we first started working at that location.</p>

<p>As much as I disliked the 40 minute commute (on good days), I really enjoyed working at the Renaissance Center, particularly when there were events like the Super Bowl and this Grand Prix because at those times it is the center of activity.</p>

<p>The IndyCar car race is on Sunday at 3:45 PM, but if you have Peacock you can watch the practice and qualifying right now and Saturday.</p>

			 <p>I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/02/bernie-sanders-debt-ceiling-bill">agree with Bernie</a>. After Biden signs the debt ceiling bill he should file suite against Congress asking the Supreme Court to declare the debt ceiling as an unconstitutional violation of the 14th amendment. The budget process is the time at which Congress set what spending it will or will not do, and Government cannot stop paying its bill it already decided in the budget to take on the cost.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with Bernie that Biden should rather than signing this bill declared the 14th amendment gives him the authority to pay the bills. The 11th hour is not the time to introduce such uncertainty, but raising the case to SCOTUS immediately after word so that there is enough time for process is the right thing to do.</p>

			 <p>Everyone wants the government to spend less. Politicians threaten to destroy the full faith and credit of the United States with claims they desire to cut spending. Logically, if you seriously want to cut spending you do so by cutting where you most spend money, and <a href="https://popular.info/p/there-is-always-more-money-for-defense">the U.S. government spends the vast majority of the money we give in taxes on the military</a>. The government makes incremental cuts on non-military programs that actually help citizens that are never intended to be consequential, while at the same time spending more in the area in which they spend the most, the military.</p>

			 <p>When I read something about the dangers of AI I can&rsquo;t help but fear the writers are missing an important point. Saying that AI is bad is like saying the Internet is bad or guns are bad. In truth none of these items are bad. What is bad, and what we need to focus on, is that there are bad people who can and will use these items to amplify what they can do and thus inflict harm on others.</p>

<p>Back before the Internet was known by most of the world those who supported it advocated for all of the good it can do, but we failed to take in to account how it can be used for harm. What is common among AI, the Internet, and guns, particularly automatic guns, is the scale and speed at which harm can be done.</p>

<p>So, my advice is, focus a bit less on the technology and more on the ways in which people want and might use that technology for harm and then craft policies aimed at constraining the the people who may do that harm. It might be making a nuanced argument, but I think it is an important one when encountering those who see themselves as needing to defend/protect the items.</p>

			 <p>One of the unwritten rules of tech is the idea that more is better, the purpose of which is to have us continually buy the latest generation of a product. The rule began with the model year releases of automobiles and became adopted by the tech industry. Unfortunately, we consumers don&rsquo;t often enough question whether the latest features really do matter. We aren&rsquo;t helped by tech reviewers who often seem to advocate more for the tech industry than consumers. An example that I am thinking about is the push for faster refresh rates on smartphones.</p>

<p>If you have read smartphone reviews over the last year or so you have probably been convinced that phones with 60Hz refresh screens are bad and really should be avoided. We all should be clamoring for 120Hz or at least 90Hz screens so that we get the fastest, smoothest screen scrolling. Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?</p>

<p>Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited,&rdquo; 60Hz screen as my daily driver. When I got the new Pixel 7a I dutifully changed the setting, as prescribed by nearly all tech reviewers, to turn on Smooth Display so that it displays at 90Hz. Every reviewer who directs one to make this change intones something to the affect, &ldquo;why is Smooth Display not enabled by default?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While I can say, yes, after turning on Smooth Display scrolling text up/down on the Pixel 7a is faster, what nobody seems to ask is, on a 6-inch display, does one really need that scrolling to be faster? I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not. Increase the size of the screen to perhaps the 11-inch standard tablet, or larger, and I can see how faster refresh can really matter, but on a 6-inch screen?</p>

<p>Another example, at least to me, is the &ldquo;insistence&rdquo; that we all need 5G wireless data on our phones. Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen? For example, I streamed video on the Pixel 7a and it looked no better to me than on the Pixel 4a. Again, if I were on a tablet or certainly a PC then I would likely benefit by the faster transfer rate, but I doubt that 5G is really going to make difference on the Pixel 7a.</p>

<p>To be fair, I do gain some benefits in the upgrade from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. I am finding the front, under-screen finger print scanner is much better than the back scanner of the 4a. The camera is much better and thus I am getting better pictures. Battery life seems to be better, probably thanks to a larger battery and the Tensor G2 chip, and I am happy to finally have the convenience of wireless charging.</p>

<p>Truth is, we likely reached peak smartphone many years ago, therefore there are really fewer needed new features that really matter, and consequently there is a need for more marketing to get people to buy phones. If you are wondering why Google will be selling the Pixel Fold, the reason why is because the smartphone &ldquo;industry&rdquo; is convinced such foldables are needed in order to keep selling phones over the next ten years. (The main case for foldables is people want to carry smaller devices, but ironically that could be served by selling phones with smaller screens!) In my opinion, the only change in smartphones that we really need is in battery life, and the technical problem of gaining more battery life from the same size batteries appears to be impossible to overcome. Ironically, one way to improve battery life is to set the screen refresh to 60Hz and use slower file transfer speeds, but then we could get by with last year&rsquo;s phone.</p>

			 <p>I have now replaced two Pixel phones with a newer model and each time I do I am astounded by how little Google understands technology ecosystems. Not only does Google require physically connecting the two phones together with a cable to transfer data, but to transfer a WearOS watch, like the Pixel Watch, from one phone to another you have to factory reset the watch. Seriously! Does anyone at Google ever even try moving from one generation phone to another?</p>

<p>Google seems to think that when one buys a new Pixel phone they are going to buy a new watch too. The factory reset of the watch would not be so bad if one could restore the watch like one can with a Pixel phone, but Google does not provide a backup of WearOS watches to their cloud.</p>

<p>Here is the process for one who owns a Pixel Watch paired with a Pixel 4a to replace the phone with a Pixel 7a. You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the &ldquo;old&rdquo; phone.</p>

<p>Over the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets. Apple has been doing this for many years, and honestly, I do not understand why Google, with all of its technical brilliance cannot figure out how to make this process of transfering from one model Pixel phone to another as pain free as possible.</p>

<p>So, once you have the phone set it comes time to pair the Pixel Watch to the new phone. The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything. Oh, and neither the Google Play store nor the Google Watch app keep track of what apps or watch faces you install on the watch, so you have figure out what to install! Anyone at Google who does such a transfer finds this acceptable ought to be embarrased, it might be the most brain dead process of all of technology!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like nobody at Google has figured it out. Transferring the Pixel Buds Pro from the Pixel 4a to the 7a works exactly how one expects, and how transferring a watch should work. No reset, no pairing, no manual configuration, just take the buds out of the case, put them in my ear, and they just work on the new phone!</p>

<p>Like the Pixel Buds, the Pixel Watch is an accessory to Pixel Phones, but the WearOS, Android, and Pixel teams seem to think the Pixel Watch is a standalone device. Sure, one can buy a watch with an LTE radio and with it and the built-in GPS the watch can function apart from the phone, but honestly, most users are not buying watches with LTE radios. Even if they do, the process of using the Play Store app on the watch to find and install apps is best described as tedious.</p>

<p>The worst part of the WearOS apps process is that Google actually had it right the first time it released their smartwatch operating system. When Google first released a smartwatch there was no way to install apps directly on the watch, you had to use the phone, and the companion app on the phone made it easy to manage the apps to install. Back then while recovering from a factory reset did not automatically restore the watch, it at least put all the apps you had installed in one spot so that you could manually trigger the installation.</p>

<p>For all the progress Google has made over the years to improve Android, Pixel phones, and develop the Pixel Watch, the lack of emphasis on making the products work together seamlessly is a huge let down. Given there have been now been several iterations of Android, WearOS, and Pixel phones, there is no excuse for why the transfer process so brain dead. What I see is a lack of diligence and a willingness to accept things that are not good enough, and I have to question whether such a company unwilling to do things right ought to be trusted playing with technology such as Artificial Intelligence that could be dangerous.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Countries such as Serbia, whose governments made the promise of security central to their power, have come to depend on keeping alive the very fears they pledged to defend their citizens against.&rdquo; &ndash; The Atlantic, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/05/serbia-mass-shootings-aftermath-gun-legislation/674067/?utm_source=feed">What the U.S. Can Learn About Gun Violence From Serbia</a></p>

<p>Compare the above to statements from U.S. politicians in the United States. The fear they foment not only increases gun sales, which makes their benefactors happy, but also adds to the thought that only an authoritarian can fix the problem. The deep irony is that the very argument made by many against gun regulation, &ldquo;first Hitler came for their guns&hellip;,&rdquo; leads to inaction, more violence, and more willingness to give up freedom for the sake of safety.</p>

			 <p>If I were in charge of <a href="https://wired.trib.al/rTNlws1">marketing a foldable phone</a>, I think I would call it a mobile 2-in-1 rather than foldable because that puts emphasis on the functionality. From using the original Surface Duo learned that you have to think of these devices as a small tablet first and a smartphone second.</p>

<p>I could be a target consumer for these devices because I am a heavy tablet user and a lite phone user, and I use both devices every day. The problem is, no foldable is ever going to be as thin as a standard smartphone and feel comfortable in front pants pockets.</p>

<p>Price is a real constraint right now. When the price drops to a comparable to smartphone + tablet then it will be more compelling. So I wonder, how long will it take for a new foldable to cost $800 or less?</p>

			 <p>It is <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/05/12/122333.html">practically impossible to trust any of the cable TV news outlets</a> because they are all owned by corporations who we know to be driven by profit motive. Even if one likes to watch Fox News or CNN and what you see is everything that you like to see, you should be smart enough to realize the only reason why you see it is for Fox or CNN to make money. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it is true and it certain is not fair and balanced or simply &ldquo;calling balls and strikes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So yes,  you can blame the networks for what they are doing, but really, the problem is with the voters who appear to rather be entertained more than participate in democracy.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/05/large-language-models-and-elections.html">advent of Large Language Models appearing as artificial intelligence</a> makes this advice more important then ever.

			 <p>The U.S. Constitution puts in place a structure of &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo; between the three branches of government to prevent tyranny, and it is that concept that limits the degree of oversight of SCOTUS by Congress. However, this structure also enables tyranny when the same wealthy parties buy SCOTUS justices and members of Congress.</p>

<p>If members of Congress, no matter party, are unwilling to actually impeach those who support their ideology to maintain freedom for all citizens and not just a select few, you have in place opportunity for corruption and defacto dictatorship.</p>

<p>The founders imagined that the threat of impeachment would be sufficient to keep people in line, but we now know that is not true. Impeachment itself is useless without conviction. If Senators are unwilling to convict a sitting President for inciting an insurrection, then for what will it ever convict a President for?</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We frequently fall in to the trap of thinking that how things work today is how they have always worked. Take for example voting in the United States. The whole concept of an &ldquo;independent voter&rdquo; is driven by the fact that today one can vote for people of different parties rather than all representatives from a single party. For example, you might vote for a Democrat for President and a Republican as your Senator.</p>

<p>What I learned while reading <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781635574630">The Age of Acrimony</a> is that in the 19th century there was only straight party ballots. The ballots may have been nothing more than a card of one of two different colors. Voting was not in private, one put their colored ballot in the ballot box while everyone else was watching. Elections could and often did become violent affairs. The invention of the ballot booth, with it&rsquo;s privacy curtain and the ability vote for people running for different offices rather than a party&rsquo;s representatives cooled the temperature of politics. It also created the idea of the &ldquo;independent&rdquo; voter.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that the temperature of politics has definitely risen to higher temperatures over the years, highlighted by the insurrection on January 6, 2021. My theory is that the idea of voting for one&rsquo;s party, no matter who is running, has become more in vogue ever since Ronald Reagan, when I think the Republican party learned during Reagan&rsquo;s second term that what letter was next to the name of the candidate was more important than the actual person. The thinking is that what is most important is the party elected to office and not the person because the party&rsquo;s ideology is what is most important for leading toward the desired outcome. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the President has dementia if the decisions are really made by his handlers.</p>

<p>I think we will see this played out most vividly during the 2024 election. Neither Biden nor Trump are popular among Democrats or Republicans, but they will vote for either the Democrat or Republican candidate. The question will be how the so-called &ldquo;independents&rdquo; will vote, and that becomes more difficult when the campaigns become nothing more than don&rsquo;t vote for the other crazy old person.</p>

<p>Politics is broken because the system is gamed towards the status quo for the benefit of those people who gain from the status quo. Today this is not only the military industrial complex, but nearly every corporation in the United States. How else can you explain why all the candidate we can seem to elect are always of the same generation? Both parties rig it so that the anointed ones are the only options, hence incumbents never are challenged from within, and the non-incumbent pool of candidates are tightly controlled.</p>

It says that the best NFL wide receivers have less eye dominance, they tend to see equally well through both eyes. Apparently Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson is unique in that he alters eye dominance depending on his location on the field.</p>

<p>I think there is a similar relationship between vision and hockey players. As I watch Michigan Tech play I often am shocked when a player makes a bad pass that leads to a turnover and a score against. It seems evident that there is a less field of vision.</p>

			 <p>The most dangerous affect of bans on books and teaching by government is its erosion on the culture of free speech. While the United States has the first amendment that prohibits government censorship of nearly all speech, a culture of &ldquo;this is how we do it here&rdquo; is more important. One way that culture is expressed is when one says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with what you are saying, but I will fight for your right to say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/an-illustrated-guide-to-self-censorship">This article</a> does a great job of explaining why free speech, and thus the freedom of expression of ideas, is so important to liberty and progress. One thing the article does not address is the consequences of time. The time it took for the national mind to change its views on smoking and gay rights was long, and in today&rsquo;s Internet time, most will now say too long.</p>

<p>What happens in a society when more citizens lived after the Internet and the compression of time that it creates? I think you see this being played out right now with the issue of trans rights, many will not tolerate change taking as long as gay rights did because the have always lived in a world of instant gratification thanks to the Internet.</p>

<p>I think the current tug of war between nearly all dualism is become so intense due to the Internet&rsquo;s affect on the expectations of change. Half of society demands fast change, the other half prefers slower change and sees the only way to achieve it is by digging in their heels so they can be comfortable. The extremes demand an all or nothing approach, either all change right now, or no change now or maybe never. Both sides are so obsessed with the outcome they cannot see the consequences of the fight.</p>

			 <p>Ironically, I read about the last print publication of Maximum PC and MacLife via RSS and the web, which long ago for me replaced computer magazines. <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2023/04/the-end-of-the-computer-magazine/">Harry McCracken writes</a> something like an obituary for the computer magazine.</p>

<p>Last week my wife told me the amazing news of a <a href="https://www.schulerbooks.com/about-west-bloomfield">new brick and mortar book store opening</a> within a mile of our house. The news brought back memories of spending hours in Borders and Barnes and Noble, both which were within a mile of our house and long since gone. (Sadly the Barnes and Noble building still sits empty more than a decade after it closed.) One of the main things I did in these stores was thumb through, and often buy, computer magazines, sometimes I would just read them while sitting in their cafe.</p>

<p>At one time I payed for subscriptions to several magazines, but over time as the web grew, there was little point in buying them. The web, and more specifically my blogs, even enabled me to live out the fantasy of being a writer like Jerry Pournelle.</p>

<p>And, so the excitement of the news about the new book store near me faded fast. Why would I shop there? Today I only buy ebooks and I get my computing news and do product research online. I know for many the medium is the message, and I truly hope there are enough such people living near me to keep the new book store open. Yes, I spent many hours browsing book stores and reading magazines but I&rsquo;ve never once missed the glossy print magazines nor the heft of Computer Shopper.</p>

People who disagree on many things can work together when they both agree to work toward solving problems, this is when compromise becomes real.

Yes, violence is part of the world, that is the self evident truth scripture tells in the story of Cain murdering Abel, which by the way is the first time the word sin appears in scripture.

			 <p>Easter has become so individualized that it has lost it&rsquo;s transformative message for the world. What really happened on Friday? The powers of the world employed the only thing they know, which is violence (the sin of the world), in an attempt to stop the movement, the Way of Jesus. On Sunday we see that the powers and their violence do not have the last word. The reason why the powers still have hold today is that we continue to believe in them.</p>

			 <p>What I think is most troubling in <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/clarence-thomas-scotus-undisclosed-luxury-travel-gifts-crow">this article about Clarence Thomas</a> is that he appears to not care how others think about him. It seems to me that a fundamental requirement of ethical behavior is actually caring about what others think. While Thomas&rsquo; continued participation in extravagant trips that he does not pay to attend is not illegal, it creates the appears of quid pro quo. Ethics isn&rsquo;t about laws, it&rsquo;s about appearance and trust. Americans are right to not trust the Supreme Court when justices don&rsquo;t care about ethics, and given that the Supreme Court is the most authoritarian branch of the U.S. government, the lack of ethics is frightening.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780062434203">Resurrecting Easter</a> by John Dominic Crossan 📚</p>

<p>Today marks the beginning of Holy Week for Christians, and every year it seems the focus is on believing the stories happened rather than pondering upon and growing from the question, how are these stories relevant today?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Crucifixion story, what we have is a parable against civilization. The kingdom of Rome is a typical kingdom within the normal protocols of this world and, as such, it is based on violent force and imperial coercion. It is simply the normalcy of civilization in Mediterranean place and first-century time. But the kingdom of God is an antitypical kingdom in that it does not even allow violent “fighting” to free Jesus from execution—recall John 18:26. So the Crucifixion and Resurrection story is not simply about Jesus clashing with or triumphing over Pilate, but about a hopeful option for humanity to find a way out of the violence-based civilization it has created for itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The true question of faith is not whether resurrection happened or has begun, but rather whether the world is being and will be transformed through our collaboration with Yahweh in Christ! Our lack of faith in the story of Jesus and in the work of Christ has us stuck in the normalcy of civilization.</p>

			 <p>I think we are getting near to testing the question of whether or not a U.S. President, former U.S. President, or a candidate for U.S. President is above the law. I don&rsquo;t think this question has ever really been answered/tested. Ford pardoned Nixon, so there never was an attempt at putting him on trial.</p>

<p>At the root of the question is whether our laws should be used for political gain. I think nobody would argue that laws should not be used for political gain, but doubt they never have been. On the other hand, the idea that anyone running for U.S. President is shielded from being put on trial does not seem right either as that means when one feels they are at risk they will simply declare their candidacy. I strongly suspect this is the reason why Trump declared he is running for President.</p>

<p>All of this reinforces how broken is the United States.</p>

All the games we really exciting and bring good energy to the start of the baseball season. I know this will never happen due to obvious reasons, but I wonder whether the games would be better if they were played later in the season or at the end when presumably all the players are at the top of their game. Japan&rsquo;s pitching really dominated. Happy that Kyle Schwarber had that big hit in the eighth inning to give us a chance, but up to that point it looked like the USA was completely out of the game.</p>

			 <p>Just this past Wednesday I found myself in a conversation about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/wokeness-definition-social-justice-racism/673416/?utm_source=feed">what is woke</a> and what is anti-woke, as the person who I was talking to didn&rsquo;t understand. I think anti-woke as it is being used is easier to define. Basically, whenever someone is claiming they are anti-woke they mean they oppose the enforcement of beliefs upon themselves or others. For some it&rsquo;s simply the label for ideas they don&rsquo;t agree with or norms/rules they don&rsquo;t want to abide by. I think at the root of this issue is a decrease in tolerance for each other. As an example, one side may say one must use proper pronouns in reference to a person, the other side says that one must not be forced to use certain words or have to listen to one other&rsquo;s beliefs because listening is the same as indoctrination.  There is no effort made to meet in the middle because each side wants their way, one side says they are just being polite, the other side says they are just using common sense.</p>

We are now in <a href="https://weather.com/science/weather-explainers/news/2021-02-28-meteorological-spring-astronomical-difference">meteorological spring</a>, meaning temperatures are now warmer on average than during the winter.

The character limit does not apply to blog posts, the character limit applies to what appears in the micro.blog timeline. As has always been, posts that are longer than X character are linked to the associated blog post that contains all of the content. From my perspective, how micro.blog handles long posts in it&rsquo;s timeline is the same as how Feedland handles long posts in the feeds list.</p>

<p>Manton could change how the timeline works to expand/collapse long posts like Dave does in the Feedland  &ldquo;news&rdquo; display, but that is his prerogative as the hosting/platform provider. As a writer, I am willing to work within the constraints that he is providing. I don&rsquo;t see the constraint as limiting me as a writer in any way because the full content is provided on my blog, which frankly is where I prefer people to actual go and read what I write.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9136909?hl=en">Google Nest Hub</a> is frustrating to use because I want to use it as an Android display, as I think I should, but instead it only provides a very narrow set of functions. The most obvious use for me is displaying a local weather radar, which is useful during weather events. A simple way Google could provide this is by enabling Radarscope to run on it.</p>

<p>Today there is an ice storm moving through my area. An option I found is a Michigan weather live stream on YouTube, which I figured I could view on the Nest Hub because it has a YouTube app. Problem is, the YouTube app on the Nest Hub only displays a list of Recommended videos and does not provide me away to select a specific video on YouTube that I can watch. How come Google didn&rsquo;t provide the FULL YouTube app on the Nest Hub.</p>

<p>I can cast the video from my Pixel 4a to the Nest Hub, but it does not make sense to me that I should have to. I couldn&rsquo;t even get Google Assistant to display the video I want. some reason why I asked it to display a video from YouTube it wants to cast it to my TV rather than on the display itself!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In 2015 <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers proposed the idea</a> of sharing one&rsquo;s status by creating a /now page off of one&rsquo;s web site. The intent of the page is simply sharing what one is doing. <a href="https://nownownow.com/">The idea caught on</a> and today many sites, some more current than others, have a now page.</p>

<p>I decided to create and maintain my /now page using Dave Winer&rsquo;s Little Outliner because I felt it was a good editor for this type of writing, and it worked particularly well with another piece of software by Dave called pagePark. <a href="https://github.com/scripting/pagePark">PagePark</a> is a HTTP server that renders the OPML files that Little Outliner creates into HTML. Dave hosts an instance of pagePark that is integrated with Little Outliner such that as soon as an outline is saved, <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml">the HTML version of that outline</a> is nearly instantly available. Consequently, the process of editing and publishing changes to my /now page was as simple and quick as loading Little Outliner and writing. Low friction increases the possibility of keeping the page current.</p>

<p>Connecting my /now page to my blog was straightforward because the hosting provider makes it easy to create pages that redirect to other pages. Therefore, when you type <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/now">https://frankmcpherson.blog/now</a> you end up at my /now page. I took the idea of the page redirect off my blog a step further by purchasing a domain, frankm.info, that I configured to forward to the site. If anyone asked me online, what am I doing, I can tell them to simply go to <a href="http://frankm.info">frankm.info</a> to find out.</p>

<p>Over time I expanded beyond the single /now page to add pages that listed <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">the technology that I use</a> and the <a href="http://2022books.frankm.info">books that I have read</a>, each with their own alias URL. Using a forwarding URL enables me to move the actual location of the files, update the forwarding destination in DNS, and instances of the alias URL that I have in my writing will point to the current location.</p>

<p>Since the time that I set all this up using Little Outliner, Dave created a new &ldquo;version&rdquo; of it called <a href="https://drummer.land">Drummer</a>. I&rsquo;ve used Drummer since its beginning and always knew that it would some day replace Little Outliner. I didn&rsquo;t move my informational outlines to Drummer until recently when Twitter made changes to its API that Dave has been using for user identity management and login. Dave announced he would be updating Drummer with a new login process and also move access of it to HTTPS. He stated he did not intend to make changes to Little Outliner, and advised anyone using it to move to Drummer as soon as possible, and at that time I migrated my files over so that I can edit them in Drummer, and I updated the alias URLs accordingly.</p>

<p>Dave had to make the changes quickly because Twitter had not stated a clear deadline by which it would cut off access to its API, and that means prioritizing what he works on first. For example, the blogging capability Drummer provides currently does not work. I am sure that capability will be restored, and Dave will get to it when he gets to it. The &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; of OPML files via an instance of pagePark is also lower on the list. Consequently, I started thinking about what I can do to restore my ability to publish updates to my /now page.</p>

<p>One option was to stop using Drummer to edit these pages, but that would create a lot of work moving the content and formattting it. The option that I took was to build my own instance of pagePark. First I tried using <a href="https://pagepark.onrender.com">an instance of pagePark</a> that I built under a free account at <a href="https://render.com">Render</a>. Render only allows HTTPS access and the free account takes the site offline after 30 minutes. When you request the site, it&rsquo;s brought online but there is a noticable delay. Consequently, I built a new virtual machine using free resources provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve updated <a href="http://projects.frankm.info">my projects outline</a> with the details about how I set this up, it was pretty straightforward after I figured out how to get around firewall issues. What I have is not integrated with Drummer, so there is now a publishing step that involves downloading the files to my computer and syncing them to my instance of pagePark. I can edit at any time with any computer, but publishing is restricted to few computers I&rsquo;ve set up.</p>

<p>Right now access to these pages is only via HTTP. I&rsquo;ve looked at the page source for Drummer to see how Dave has changed the includes and I think I should be able to edit the templates pagePark uses with the right form of those includes to eliminate the mixed content errors. I intend to use the instance of pagePark I have on Render to test that work when I have time. If I get access to these files working on Render I will then have to decided how to handle the SSL certificates if I move off Render, which I would probably do by using Caddy.</p>

			 <p>If one is a child, a teenager, a college student in the United States, aware of the realities of the society that they currently live in, how can you possibily conclude anything other than the fact that the generations older, now Millenials through Baby Boomers, don&rsquo;t care about them at all? It&rsquo;s seems we have all forgotten the desire for providing our children a better life than our own. Better should be safer. Instead we do absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>I am Gen-X, and to my recollection the last time enough people in power were shocked enough by a shooting was in 1993 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act">the Brady Bill</a> was passed. Looking back from today, it seems that only the attempted murder of an old white man who happens to be President lead to action. Not murders of elementary, high school, and college students.</p>

<p>I see people of my generation ripping on younger generations as &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; and &ldquo;lazy&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t seem to really care why. Might it be that in the United States the probability of a kindergartener experiencing an in-school shooting before graduating high school is greater than zero? I don&rsquo;t know this is a fact, but I know it&rsquo;s true, but the fact is that truth does not piss off enough people to take action.</p>

<p>Parents and grandparents need to stop convincing themselves their child will never face a shooting. It&rsquo;s time to stop numbing ourselves hoping that it will never happen. <strong>It&rsquo;s time to face the reality that it will happen, to your child, someone you love, maybe tomorrow.</strong></p>

<p>“I have heard that the ultimate expression of worship is obedience to a God-given command, submission, and giving. I have also heard that the ultimate expression to God is serving. But personal evolution leads me to believe that the ultimate expression of worship to God is being—being whom He created me to be. It is doing what He created me to do, being my purpose, and therefore doing my purpose. If I were asked, today, “What is worship to you?” Worship is doing what I’ve been created to do, what I am purposed to do and that is, to just be.”</p>

			 <p>Truth is, iPads and Macs are tools, and the choice between which one is used is not life and death. It&rsquo;s ok to choose a Mac over an iPad, and vice versa, and there is no real reason to try and convince someone that their choices are wrong. Apple does not expect either device to be the best for every single use case, otherwise they would only sell one device.</p>

			 <p>As the iPad has never been intended to function exactly like notebook and desktop computers, I doubt Apple will ever make them work exactly the same. You are never going to see MacOS running on iPads even if it could. Power users have been pushing Apple to make the iPad function more like Macs, and honestly iPadOS has moved a long way toward that direction. Much more than I would have ever expected. But the reality is, the iPad is never going to be a MacOS tablet and so one needs to come to terms with that reality. (Do you really want a Windows Tablet?)</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s shocking to me that so many Christians could read <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/tyre-nichols-white-supremacy-racism/672903/?utm_source=feed">this article</a> and not realize that Jesus enountered <a href="Luke 10:25-29">this problem</a> and taught <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10%3A30-37&amp;version=NRSVUE">the answer</a>.  We Christians do not live out what Jesus taught, and thus provide no example to and have no moral authority with those with whom we occupy this planet.</p>

<p>P.S. Note that Jesus did not say, &ldquo;love your neighbor like you love yourself,&rdquo; he said something even more profound, &ldquo;love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo; You are a part of me that I do not yet know.</p>

<p>“I believe it is impossible to overstate the defining nature of the empire of force among us, if empire is understood as a political, economic, military, ideological practice of self-security and control. It is not clear that life can be construed beyond empire; but the poets have to try. The poets, because they are poets, never arrive there, for their poetry would then become program. That, however, does not render the poetry as a failure or as an irrelevance. It only affirms that alternatives to the lethal reductionism of empire require imagination and courage and staying power. In that ancient world, it was required that old Jerusalem be relinquished and new Jerusalem be undertaken. It is no less required now that there be relinquishing and undertaking.”</p>

			 <p>“It is all good news &hellip; but you have to go! Israel has always been departing empire. That is how it began back in Egypt and that is how Nebuchadnezzar became the dominant metaphor for imperial power vis-à-vis the peculiar destiny of Israel. That has been the summons of Jesus to his people since his first “follow me.” He summoned away from all old regimes into the new regime that he inaugurated. To make a large, imaginative move, I suggest that it is the task of followers of this gospel in our society—who live in the totalitarian regime of military consumerism with all of its hopes and violences and anxieties—to depart.”</p>

			 <p>Dave is <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/26/145052.html">pointing out the relationship</a> between the United States paying its bills, the value of the U.S. dollar as the the world&rsquo;s reserve currency, and how that all translates to life as we know it in the United States. What Dave does not point out is that the the U.S. dollar being the world&rsquo;s reserve currency is a fundamental part of the United States Empire. It&rsquo;s how we can punish other nations like Russia and Iran with &ldquo;economic&rdquo; sanctions or why cutting Russia off from SWIFT (which is the network that all banks, including national banks use to move money around) is in fact punishing.</p>

<p>While (like the Roman empire) we have built U.S. Armed forces bases all around the world, U.S. citizens, let alone the world, will not accept frequent military intervention, so the bases are mostly for show of power and rapid deployment capability. Consequently, the economic tools, like the reserve currency, are the tools of choice that we use to flex U.S. might.</p>

<p>I think most nations know exactly how the U.S. uses the reserve currency status to imposes its will upon them and that is why some of them are considering using something other than the dollar. The U.S. missing payment on its bills will provide good reason for the nations to pull the trigger and that could start the fall of the U.S. empire. If this happens we will find out quickly just how much our way of life has grown to depend on empire.</p>

<p>P.S. The United States is the only country in the world to have dropped nuclear weapons on another country. The fact that we were willing then to do such a thing and the fact that we use our economic muscle to enforce our empire makes us the bad guys for most of the world. The good life we enjoy keeps us from seeing our shadow self.</p>

			 <p>Much that is wrong in the United States can be traced back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>, because he created and taught the doctrine in place in corporate America that everything, absolutely everything, is about making the wealthy class wealthier. Corporations exist to make wealth, and labor is simply the disposable batteries needed to fuel their wealth.</p>

<p>And, of course, the wealthy class fears the labor class, which is why they own those bunkers and houses on islands as far away from civilization as possible. For some, Mars or the moon may not be far enough. (And definitely do not allow labor to organize against us!)</p>

<p>The United States was founded upon and institutionalized class structure. White men ruled and controled Europe in the seventeenth century, how could anyone think that was not how America was structured? Madison, Jefferson, Washington, and Hamilton knew no different, it was and has been the &ldquo;norm of society.&rdquo; (By the way, this structure goes back well before the time of Jesus and he was killed by the state and the religious ruling class for preaching an alternative to the structure. Consequently, the U.S. might be called a christian nation by the defintion of institutionalzied christianity, but would not be called so by Jesus.)</p>

<p>Ours in the United States has been a more than 200 year struggle over the question of liberty for whom? Explicity at the founding liberty was only for white male property owners. Over the years laws and Constitutional ammendments have been passed to try and expand liberty to more people, but really, the class structure remains. The people at the top benefit so much from the way things are there is no real incentive to change. How else can the right hand of the U.S. institution, the Supreme Court, think that structural racism is no longer an issue, thus voting rights are not longer needed, or that anti-abortion laws are not a infringment on the liberty of nearly half the country, or that corporations (which is THE insitution of the wealthy class) have the same rights as citizens and should thus be allowed so spend as much money to buy politicians as they wish?</p>

<p><a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/google-should-fire-sundar-pichai">Mass layoffs</a> are the dopamine of the wealthy class. No CEO is ever going to be fired for announcing such a layoff because it is exactly what the wealthy class demands. Any CEO and board of a U.S. corporation knows that the quickest way to boost their stock price is by announcing a round of layoffs or buy announcing stock buy backs. Few CEOs know how to build anything, they only know the financial engineering they were taught in business school and what they see done all around them.</p>

<p>P.S. If you are invested in a 401k, you are being told that your interests align with the wealthy class. Assimilation is a very powerful tool of those in power.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve finished reading a fantastic three part series about the history of ARM written by Jeremy Reimer for Ars Technica. Here is a quote from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/a-history-of-arm-part-3-coming-full-circle/">the end of the series</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the key to Saxby’s management approach was simple yet uncommon in the business world: ARM grew because it helped others grow. It treated its employees more like people and less like human resources, giving them chances to learn and succeed along with the company. “I’m a great believer that in any team,” he told me, “any member is better at something than somebody else, so to get the team to perform you want everyone to perform on their best axis. Teams that work well together work better.” He emphasized the importance of being honest with employees and not overpromising what the company had to offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above resonates with me because the company I hired in to out of college, Electronic Data Systems, had the same business model, treat employees in a similar manner, and had success. Unlike ARM, EDS went through several different owners (GM, HP, HPE, CSC/DXC) and CEOs and each change moved further from the founding vision to the point at which it no-longer really exists.</p>

<p>The story also calls to mind <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780735213524">The Infinite Game</a> by Steve Sinek. Using Reimer&rsquo;s comparison of ARM and Commodore, ARM was playing the infinite game, Commodore the finite game. In the book Sinek describes the reletively few businesses playing the &ldquo;infinite game&rdquo; versus the vast majority playing the &ldquo;finite&rdquo; game. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infinite games have infinite time horizons. And because there is no finish line, no practical end to the game, there is no such thing as “winning” an infinite game. In an infinite game, the primary objective is to keep playing, to perpetuate the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having been hired by EDS and surviving through the multitude of transitions that has occurred, I have seen first hand the differences a building a company, which usually has a founder, and buying a company, which usually has a manager. In most cases bought companies are separated from their founding, has no leadership and thus no culture.</p>

<p>It amazes me that given all the evidence of how to achieve long term success, such as ARM&rsquo;s, that so few U.S. companies are interested in the infinite game. The finite game rules business, thus it rules capitalism, and given relationship of capitalism to the United States, the finite game rules the U.S. I don&rsquo;t think prospects will change in the United States until we find leaders who are builders, right now our political, economic, and religions cultures appear to all be playing the finite game.</p>

But when one person says it’s love and the other person walks away wounded, we don’t call that love or truth or grace. We call it abuse.”</p>

			 <p>Nobody should be surprised that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/12/exxon-climate-research-predicted-global-warming">big oil has long known the impact of carbon on the the climate</a>, just as big tobacco long knew about the relationship of nicotine on cancer. Likewise, I am certain Facebook, Twitter, and Google all know the impact of social networks on mental health.</p>

<p>In my opinion the root cause to this behavior is the acceptance in the United States that it&rsquo;s ok for one to profit from the misery of another. Any means toward the ends of more and more profits to the oligarchs is accepted by everyone, even for whom are the most affected.</p>

<p>If you truly read the history of the United States you will learn that from the discovery of the content through to present time the United States has existed to make one class of people rich at the expense of anyone and anything that would be in the way of that class becoming more rich. This fact has made the United States, and many other countries in the Western Hempisphere very different from other countries in the world.</p>

<p>The history of the United States is very much a fight, back and forth, between the oligarchs and everyone else. Everyone else won over the oligarchs in the U.S. Civil War, but the oligarchs clawed their way back up until FDR and the New Deal. Ever since the end of WW II the oligarchs have been fighting back and gained great ground during the Reagan years, and their accendancy has continued ever since no matter which poliitcal party has been in power.</p>

<p>Today it appears that everything is in place for the oligarchs to completely assume control over nearly everything in the United States. Trump pretty much sealed the deal by placing the oligarch&rsquo;s choice of justices to the Supreme Court, under the disguise of overturning Roe v. Wade. More consequential rulings are coming to remove the New Deal, Civil Rights, and election laws that were put in place as guardrails against the oligarchs.</p>

<p>On the eve of the Civl War everyone else rose up against the oligarchs by forming a new political party (Republicans), and electing Abraham Lincoln, which lead to the Civl War and the oligarch&rsquo;s defeat. Unfortunately, the oligarchs appear to have closed that risk to them by changing election laws and the amont of money it takes to be elected President to insure no party that they don&rsquo;t control can possibly be a threat. At the moment it seems to me the only real possible equally dramatic act would be for enough states to open a Constitutional Convention that would fundamentally re-form the United States for good or ill.</p>

			 <p>Ken Smith writes about what he calls <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/KenSmith/2023/01/12/190337.html?title=essentialFluency">Essential Fluency</a> that I think relates to <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/01/11/seth-godin-says.html">my reaction to Seth Godin&rsquo;s call for the end of high school essays</a>. Also related to these topics is another article that was sent via email, the gist of it calling for universities to be replaced by corporate-sponsored trade schools.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s much of a stretch to say that education in the United States is a mess. At the root of the problem is a belief that in order for one to obtain a good paying job in the United States one must have a college degree. I think this approach is a contributor to the huge wealth gap in the United States because not everyone has the aptitude, not to mention the financial resources, to get a college degree.</p>

<p>I think part of the answer to the problem is a increased emphasis on experience and skills, which I relate to Ken Smith&rsquo;s post about fluency, and a decreased empahsis on degrees and certifications. Most corporate funded education looks more like certifications.</p>

<p>Using experience as a scale, you could put people in two categories of jobs: entry level and non-entry level. A person hired in to an entry level position would be expected to have the rudimentary skills (reading, writing, math) but the company hiring them would provide the full suite of training need ot fill the roles of the  company. No-entry level would be direct hire in to the roles. In neither of these cases is a college degree needed.</p>

			 <p>Seth Godin says <a href="https://seths.blog/2023/01/the-end-of-the-high-school-essay/">good riddance to high school essays</a>. Apparently he doesn&rsquo;t see the value in learning how to write, in how to construct a clear and compelling message that one reads. Apparently the fact that still more than the majority of what is on the Internet is in written form doesn&rsquo;t matter. Ask any college professor about the quality of writing seen from students. Although, given that it&rsquo;s so bad today, perhaps just not even bothering to teach kids how to write is the way. I mean, it&rsquo;s not like we really care about education in the United States because that would lead to more equality, and equality impedes the liberty of those at the top of the pyramid.</p>

			 <p>It seems to happen every time there is a migration of people from one application to another. When the new people start using the new application they seem to expect that the features and functions of the previous application to exist in the new one. When they can&rsquo;t find the function, they ask where it is, and if they are told that it doesn&rsquo;t exist it seems they then start to complain or at least doubt the reasons for why the function doesn&rsquo;t exist with the alternate application.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the idea that every application should work exactly the same is problematic. Micro.blog was created specifically to not be Twitter and Mastodon was created specifically to not be Twitter, and the value of these applications are that they are not Twitter!</p>

<p>And you know what, it&rsquo;s ok! Life can exist without a &ldquo;like&rdquo; button and it can exist without a quote &ldquo;tweet.&rdquo;  We don&rsquo;t need to change the minds of those who disagree, we just need to figure out how to co-exist.</p>

			 <p>Below refers to the writing of Lincoln Steffens in 1904, and very apt questions at the end of 2022. Emphasis added</p>

<p>“After Steffens laid out the corruption of seven cities, his conclusion pointed straight at readers in their easy chairs. The simple truth, Steffens wrote, was that politicians were expert readers of public demands, and the public had not demanded good government. <strong>Instead, for decades they had been driven by outrage, alternately between political parties, throwing out one set of bums, then the other.</strong> Steffens asked: “Do we Americans really want good government? Do we know it when we see it? Are we capable of that sustained good citizenship which alone can make democracy a success?””</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the largest deal that Jed Hoyer’s front office has inked during his time in charge, and it’s just really not that big of a contract relative to the rest of the league or the Cubs monetary might. It doesn’t crack the top ten in MLB in years or AAV. It is the second largest deal in the history of the Cubs franchise, and it is nowhere near the top 20 contracts as of 2021, let alone ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What I see in Hoyer is a baseball executive afraid to make a mistake. Under the rubric of sustaining success one may never have the chance to win championships. What we appear to have here is a plan of waiting to see how the season goes, and if half way through they have a real chance, then make trades to sign players you need, which is what happened in 2016.</p>

<p>The question then is whether the Cubs have enough talent going in to the season to have a good first half and be buyers at the trade deadline. With the players they have signed and the young talent they have, the 2023 Chicago Cubs on paper are better than the 2022 Chicago Cubs, the problem though is that the Cardinals have also gotten better, and they added Wilson Contreras to a team with the reigning MVP.</p>

<p>Hoyer has been a big part of the decision making since after the Cubs won the World Series. Since 2017 the Cubs have regressed in their effort to return to the World Series. Looking for changes from the same people making decisions is insane, you need to change the decision makers to get a different result.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the Chicago Cub&rsquo;s division competitors have become much better this off season than the Cubs, and so they are losing the offseason. It might be that the Cubs surprise with their own talent, but I think that Ricketts has to start losing patience with Hoyer. If the Cubs are at the bottom of the division and out of the running by June, I think Hoyer must go. If Hoyer continues to stay then I can only conclude that he is performing to the level Ricketts expects and therefore all the talent decisions are on him.</p>

			 <p>I am testing sending what I write in my blogs to Day One via an <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> applet that is monitoring their RSS feeds. There are two problems. First, the IFTTT applet doesn&rsquo;t do a good job of handling titleless posts, second, hyperlinks in the posts are stripped, seemingly even if I create the links using markdown.</p>

<p>The applet simply creates new entries to Day One in an order and it appears that if the title is blank then the next entry in the item content is used for the title, which by default that is the item link. I moved the item link to below the item content, but my temporary work around is to configure the applet to create a &ldquo;default&rdquo; title for every post, with the actual title, it it exists, on the following line. but this is not optimal.</p>

<p>It looks like I could add some Javascript logic to the applet so I am wondering if I could simply write some code to inspect the feed title and skip it, but that may take some time to figure it out. I wonder whether anyone else has already done this?</p>

Good news is that the weekly reported cases is flat compared to this time last year. Bad news is that the infection rate, which is a leading indicator to the community numbers, is trending upward having been relatively level (up and down around 1) since August. It doesn&rsquo;t look like we will reach the levels of new cases through the end of December and January like we did last year, but we clearly are getting the somewhat expected increases with the holidays and colder weather upon us.</p>

I think it was widely expected that the 2022 midterm elections would be highly influenced by inflation and the state of the economy that we are now experiencing, but yet it was abortion and election denial that influenced the election even more. I wonder though, is the fact that these topics were the main influencers good? Or was the result of the election that those who are profiting significantly from our current state given a free pass?</p>

			 <p>It seems that at least once a year something happens with Evernote, the company, that results in a number of people deciding to ditch Evernote, the app. I am a long time, paying customer of Evernote and for the moment I don&rsquo;t intend to change unless I need to. However, Evernote for me is more of a repository than a notetaking application. I particularly like it&rsquo;s web clipping, but I also forward particular emails such as emailed receipts.</p>

<p>A while back I decided it was worth trying export some or all of my Evernote notebooks and import them to another app, just in case something were to happen. I found that the best import was to DEVONthink and the second best was OneNote. I tested with an eval copy of DEVONthink but decided to not buy it as what I got in to OneNote was good enough.</p>

			 <p>I play in two fantasy football leagues, one that uses the ESPN app and the other that uses Yahoo. I find it interesting how opinionated both apps are in terms of how they are used on tablets and phones. On iPads the apps only work in landscape orientation no matter which way one is holding the iPad, which I find frustrating because they are literally the only apps on my iPad that does this. On my smartphones the apps only work in portrait, again no matter how you actually hold the phone.</p>

<p>The smartphone behavior is even more interesting on the Microsoft Surface Duo. I have the two apps in a group so they both launched, one on each screen, and they look fine when I am holding the Duo in &ldquo;book&rdquo; or landscape orientation, but when I rotate the Duo into portrait orientation the apps rotate to maintain portrait while the individual screens are landscape.</p>

<p>Regardless of the platform, I find it very hostile to me as a user that the app only works in one way as this is completely unlike any other app. It&rsquo;s as if the developers don&rsquo;t actually use the platforms for which they are developing.</p>

It makes good points, but in my opinion does not go deep enough. To truly grow, learn the difference between joy and happiness. Happiness is dependent on externalities, whereas joy is a state of being. Said differently, joy is a conscious choice, a practice if you, for how to see everything. Happiness will not help you love your opponent, but joy will.</p>

Richard Rohr walks the reader through the core of Jesus&rsquo; teaching presented in the Sermon On The Mount.</p>

			 <p>We tend to think about RSS in terms of web sites and web applications and what gets over looked is how you can use it personally. For example, I send items from <a href="http://feedland.org">FeedLand</a> to <a href="http://radio3.io">Radio3</a> to add to my linkblog. I have an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> applet monitoring the linkblog RSS file that takes new items and adds them to <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>, which retrieves and stores the full article content that I read later.</p>

<p>As I read articles in Pocket I might highlight parts that I want to remember. The highlights in Pocket are grabbed by <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise</a>, where I can read through them and have them presented to me daily. Finally, Readwise exports the article highlights to Roam and Evernote.</p>

<p>In this example RSS is the backbone to my personal knowledge collection and refinement.  It glues together for me hundreds of web sites and six applications.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="http://daytona.scripting.com">Daytona</a> is effectively a personal search engine that indexes the OPML files stored with my Drummer account. I am able to use it to search through a good chunk of my writing that I have published to the web over the last decade.</p>

<p>What I would like is to get what I add to <a href="http://radio3.io/users/frankm/rss.xml">my linkblog feed</a>, which is RSS/XML, in to Daytona. What I need is a way to copy new entries of an RSS file to an OPML file that could be stored in Drummer and indexed by Daytona. I don&rsquo;t need this to happen in real time, I could live with producing the file once a month. Note that you can see my linkblog feed in the <a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/?tab=links">Links tab of my daynotes site</a>.</p>

<p>I imagine a nodejs script that takes as input a RSS xml file, reads each item and creates a new OPML node with the content and link to the article. The output would be a corresponding OPML file written in the same directory that I could import in to Drummer. The OPML structure could be based on the date. For example, the top level node is the month, and the child nodes would be date. Pretty much the Drummer blog structure. The RSS items on a date would be children of the date nodes.</p>

<p>If I had such a RSS to OPML script I would use it to make OPML versions of my Radio3 linkblog feed, my FeedLand Feed, and maybe even my micro.blog RSS file. The result would index all the content I publish to the web in Daytona that I could then search for when desired.</p>

			 <p>The only stream that I follow consistently and frequently is my RSS stream. While I cross post what I write on my blog to Twitter, I don’t check Twitter often, mostly just during events like the Super Bowl. I check my micro.blog stream a couple times a day, and I frankly appreciate its smaller size (relative to Twitter) that makes it easier to get to know people over time.</p>

<p>I created an account on Mastodon this week, but it overwhelms me in the same way as Twitter. Too much from too many people I don’t know. I feel like I am already at max news/social streams and don’t need more nor alternatives. Debating about whether I even want to find an app for Mastodon to put on my iPad.</p>

To be a tile is basically an app, and I find it hard to really differentiate between the two. My main complaint is that recents is not really recents, and seems to constantly change to whatever WearOS thinks I would want. For some reason Fitbit Exercise, which is my swipe left tile, and Fitbit today always end up at the top of recents.</p>

<p>A reason for the dismantling of pensions and the attacks on social security is to make us all capitalists through 401ks. The above is as much a description of Trump as it is of Musk. The oligarchs have been at war with the citizens of the United States since the 1930s.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s clear to me how <a href="http://feedland.org/?river">FeedLand</a> is a reboot of RSS because it makes <a href="http://feedland.org/?log">building and managing a list RSS feeds</a> real easy. Ever since he released Radio Userland I have been using Dave Winer&rsquo;s blog and RSS products, and I have been using River5 for many years. Radio Userland was unlike any other RSS product I have used because it fused reading (RSS) and writing (blogging) in one product, River5 and <a href="http://radio3.io">Radio3</a> is the split of those two functions, and I still use Radio3 for my linkblogging and adding items to read later to Pocket.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> is a Nodejs application that you can clone to your own server, which I have running in Google Cloud. The main difficulty with River5 is in maintaining one&rsquo;s RSS subscription list because it ultimately has to be accessed via a file that is stored locally on the server running River5. My solution has been to add an include node in the local subscription file, and store the file that is included in AWS where I can edit using Little Outliner via <a href="https://github.com/scripting/nodeStorage">nodeStorage</a>. FeedLand removes the hassle of figuring out where to put and how to edit my RSS subscriptions at the price of the app being hosted by Dave rather than on one of my own servers.</p>

<p>If your remember Google Reader and wish it still exists, I strongly encourge you to check out <a href="http://feedland.org">FeedLand</a> because in my opinion it does what Google Reader provided, but more!</p>

Today it&rsquo;s clear to me that for too many people in the United States if democracy enables an African American to be President then they do not want democracy.</p>

			 <p>Currently reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781635574630">The Age of Acrimony</a> by Jon Grinspan 📚</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the 1860s through the early 1900s, presidential elections drew the highest turnouts ever reached, were decided by the closest margins, and witnessed the most political violence. Racist terrorism during Reconstruction, political machines that often operated as organized crime syndicates, and the brutal suppression of labor movements made this the deadliest era in American political history. The nation experienced one impeachment, two presidential elections &ldquo;won&rdquo; by the loser of the popular vote, and three presidential assassinations. Control of Congress rocketed back and forth, but neither party seemed capable of tackling the systemic issues disrupting Americans&rsquo; lives. Driving it all, a tribal partisanship captivated the public, folding racial, ethnic, and religious identities into two warring hosts.</p>

			 <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is the most authoritarian branch of U.S. government. Nearly every low moment of U.S. History is tied to Supreme Court decisions, some which later were overturned. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-conservative-stalwart-challenging-the-far-right-legal-theory-that-could-subvert-american-democracy?utm_source=pocket_mylist">A case will go in front of the Supreme Court in December</a> that could decide the fate of demoracy in the United States. It could give state legislatures power to decide any federal election, overturning the will of the people. Given the current make up of the court, I am not optimistic that demoracy will survive.</p>

			 <p>I think 538 has made a pretty <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/aaron-rodgers-deep-ball-struggles/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">good analysis of the Green Bay Packers&rsquo; offense</a>, although I disagree with their inferrence that Rodgers can improve the offense on his own. Truth is, any quarterback, even former MVPs need an offensive line that blocks and wide receives who can get open and catch the ball. Rodgers has neither. Why was Rodgers MVP last year? Davante Adams. Right now the Green Bay Packers have no reliable pass receiver, period.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if the Packers were to make a trade mid season, and I doubt they would because they are still old school, they should trade Rodgers. There is no season hanging on to a quarterback of his calliber if you aren&rsquo;t going to surround him with play makers. Frankly, they have been doing to Aaron what they did to Brett, it&rsquo;s just that this time they didn&rsquo;t draft an Aaron Rodgers to replace him.</p>

			 <p>I find <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/17/have-mlbs-revamped-playoffs-made-the-baseball-season-an-unfair-mockery">the complaining</a> about the current results of this year&rsquo;s MLB playoffs ridiculous. While it&rsquo;s true that three teams that won more than 100 games this year have not made it to the league championships, those teams had the same chance to win their five game series than the teams they lost to.</p>

<p>No professional nor college sport simply have the regular season league champions play each other at the end of a season to decide which team is the best for that season. Yes, even baseball once had a four team championship series before the World Series. All sport playoffs simply decide who is the tournament champion, and the reason why tournaments are appealing is because they have upsets.</p>

<p>Regular sports seasons are played for a team&rsquo;s opportunity to participate in the tournament, and for the fan&rsquo;s enjoyment in watching their team compete for that right. Tournaments are for leagues and teams to make lots of money off the drama they create.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-daughter-was-right-regret-iphone-14-pro-max-2022-9?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Business Insider implies</a> that Apple did something wrong with the iPhone 14, the author regrets upgrading from the iPhone 13. What is really wrong is the author thinking of it as an upgrade to the iPhone 13 and then buying the phone, but there <strong>shouldn&rsquo;t</strong> be a reason why one buys a new phone every year. The iPhone 14 isn&rsquo;t to replace the iPhone 13, it&rsquo;s just this year&rsquo;s model that if one owns an iPhone and wants to replace it with the current model, then that is the one to buy.</p>

<p>In fact, probably the only real reason why the iPhone 14 is called the iPhone 14 is because that makes it easier to talk and write about. In practice, we should think of the iPhone like a car. The iPhone 14 is the 2023 model of the iPhone. Next year Apple will announce and start selling the 2024 model fo the iPhone.</p>

<p>Very few people replace their car every year because the model they bought works just fine, and that&rsquo;s a good thing otherwise there would be a lot more junkyards.</p>

			 <p>It might be shocking to some to realize that the question of whether the United States is a single country or a union of states is not decided. One would think that the question was answered at the end of the Civil War, except that the 10th amendment was not repealed. Nor was the electoral college, nor other parts of the constitution that treat states as sovereign. Consequently, we live with the reality that citizen&rsquo;s votes are not equal in Presidential elections. If you live in California, your vote matters less than if you live in Ohio. It&rsquo;s not right, but it&rsquo;s a consequence of where one chooses to live.</p>

<p>Those who benefit from the status quo <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3638807-when-not-if-should-the-electoral-college-be-eliminated/">see the Electoral College as a feature rather than a flaw</a>.</p>

			 <p>Part of the backlash against Biden&rsquo;s plan to forgive federal student loans is really a backlash against education. College education has become stereotyped into identities that some dislike. The fact that American society has pushed the necessity of a college degree for one to get a good job and have a good life is also problematic and wrong.</p>

<p>Scary thing is, true education in which one practices critical thinking and decision making is more critical now than ever. The United States is not and was not ever intended to be a pure democracy. Our government is a representative democracy, which by definition means there are gatekeepers, some voted in to positions (Congress, the President), some appointed by those we voted for (Supreme Court, Attorney General, Secretary of State), and some defacto (political parties, the Press).</p>

<p>Technology is eroding away the whole idea of gatekeepers upon whom our country was built, which slides us towards pure democracy. At first this might seem like a good thing, but what it really means is that more responsibility is with citizens. From within democracy tyranny can easily emerge, all it takes is to convince enough people that the tyrant&rsquo;s cause is virtuous.</p>

<p>The guardrails against tyranny is education and free speech, and liberty to practice both. Critical thinking and systemic decision making. If we are left to not trust politicians, journalists, or anybody else for that matter, then we need to be able to trust ourselves. Education does not necessarily mean a college degree, but it does mean an openness to idea that one might be wrong, the desire to understand why, and the willingness to change one&rsquo;s mind.</p>

			 <p>“Our religion can “hell-ify” us by inspiring in us an impenetrable sense of rightness or even <strong>superiority</strong>. That sense of rightness can inoculate us against humility, infusing in us an excessive confidence or addiction to certainty that keeps us from seeing our mistakes until after the harm has been done—to others (including our children) and to ourselves. Our religion is right, we believe, which makes us right. As a result, the more devoted we are, the more stubborn and unteachable we become. And everyone can see it but us, because we’re blinded by our sincerity and zeal.”</p>

<p>— <a href="https://a.co/5uTY4uh">Do I Stay Christian?: A Guide for the Doubters, the Disappointed, and the Disillusioned</a> by Brian D. McLaren</p>

<p>A big problem in American society, perhaps the problem, is too much religion. The reason why is because most people do not know what religion is, that it is more than agreeing to a set of beliefs or attending a church. Re-ligio means to re-bind, but &ldquo;re&rdquo; anything infers we do it already. What we bind ourselves to is how we see ourselves, it becomes our very identity, our idolatry. Everything we bind ourselves to is a layer of our false self, put in place from the outside.</p>

			 <p>The Kansas State Supreme Court, in their decision that the Kansas state constitution provided the right to abortion by borrowing from the language of the Declaration of Independence: &ldquo;All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&rdquo; <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/08/06/what-happened-in-kansas-americans-know-that-rights-are-not-just-suggestions/">They wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Included in that limited category is the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one&rsquo;s own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination. This right allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life—decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am glad to see someone other than me define liberty as including the ability to have control over one&rsquo;s own body. Unfortunately, SCOTUS does not agree with the Kansas State Supreme Court about that same language. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court is attacking liberty for all for the sake of a perceived infringement on religious liberty is very dangerous, although sadly no unprecedented, SCOTUS has been attacking liberty practically since its beginning.</p>

			 <p>Greed drives <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/08/05/nikkei-taiwan-propaganda">most of the capitalism in the United States</a> with little thought about the consequences. We are currently living through the consequences of a war a world away between Russia and Ukraine, imagine what happens if war breaks out in the Far East where everything we buy and use in the United States is manufactured. Have you tried to buy a car lately? Greed has put us in this bad place where China has a vice grip on our economy.</p>

<p>In the 1920s greed drove the United States and the world over a financial cliff toward a Depression. It took a World War and the New Deal laws to get the country back on its feet, but the wealthy minority, which has a lot of power because everything including votes and court decisions can be bought in the U.S., has been waging war against the majority, what we once knew as the middle class, ever since. Everything going on in the U.S. is a consequence if this war.</p>

<p>At the root of the issue is the claims on the definition of liberty. On one side, that includes the wealthy, is the claim liberty means one can do whatever one wants. On the other side is the claim that one&rsquo;s claim to their personal liberty ends when it infringes on the liberties of others. The extreme libertarian side pushes toward anarchy, the extreme other side pushes toward over regulation, and in the middle is supposed to be the idea of the rule of law.</p>

			 <p>I received the Google Pixelbuds yesterday as promised by USPS and so far I am very happy with how they work. They were discovered by my Pixel 4a and setup went smoothly. The Pixelbuds are associated to my Google account and so my work phone that runs Android and knew about the Pixelbuds and displayed a notification to associate it and install the Pixebuds app. More first impressions notes on <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">my tech information page</a>.</p>

			 <p>Six years ago I felt positive things were happening for the Chicago Cubs. <a href="http://sports.frankmcpherson.net/2014/09/01/theBuzzOnTheNorthSide.html">I wrote then</a> about all the young talent that was getting a chance to play and looked forward to the future. Honestly, I feel a bit that way this year. The Cubs young guys who have been given a chance to play have demonstrated they are capable. I think next year they should be competitive in the NL Central.</p>

			 <p>Against my better judgement, I ordered the new Google Pixelbuds Pro from the Google Store and once again I have evidence that delivery of products from the Google Store is at best cursed if not flat out incompetent.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found that Google shipped the Pixelbuds via UPS, which I thought was good because UPS seems to know what they are doing, but then I saw the indicator that it is really via Mail Innovations. I think this is the service in which UPS and the USPS partner in delivery with UPS doing the cross country transport and USPS doing the last mile, and it means more moving parts to fail.</p>

<p>The Pixelbuds shipped out of Bensenville, IL on July 26 and arrived in a UPS sorting facility in Urbancrest, OH, which is a suburb of Columbus. According to the UPS tracker, the package then was delivered to USPS in West Bloomfield, MI, which is where I live, on July 29 but rather than being delivered to me on August 1 as originally expected the next update on that date was another &ldquo;sorted&rdquo; at UPS facility in Urbancrest, OH.</p>

<p>To date the package has yet to arrive. I know there is no guarantee date and that I did not pay extra for shipping, but I am wondering why it appears stuck in Ohio as if nobody knows what to do with it. I can&rsquo;t remember whether I even had the option to pay for delivery.</p>

<p>Worse, despite the fact that when I click the &ldquo;Track Package&rdquo; link in the notification of shipment email that Google sends goes to a ups.com site, when I manually enter the tracking number via my UPS.com account it indicates as not a UPS shipment. I go to usps.com and it indicates it &ldquo;departed shipping partner facility&rdquo; on July 28 in Grove City, OH, which is probably the same location indicated by UPS, but there is no other update on the USPS site.</p>

<p>None of these shippers provide me, a user, to click a link on these tracking pages to send to the shipper and ask them what is up with my shipment, even when I have an account set up with their site. I use Informed Delivery with USPS and normally as soon as a USPS shipping label is printed I get a text notification, but not this time. I can only conclude that &ldquo;Main Innovations&rdquo; is a very cheap and thus low quality shipping serivce. The bottom line to me is that Google Store compromises on customer service for the sake of cutting costs. It all adds up to a once again poor experience with Google Store.</p>

<p>Prior three orders of phones and the Pixelbook, which are more expensive items, where delivered to the wrong address. I get packages from Amazon and other online stores via UPS and Fedex with no problem, but every dang one from Google Store is messed up.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just got a text from USPS that the package arrived in West Bloomfield and will be delivered tomorrow.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.bleachernation.com/cubs/2022/08/02/the-cubs-do-not-trade-willson-contreras-or-ian-happ/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Shock in Wrigleyville</a> as the Cubs did NOT trade Wilson Contreras or Ian Happ as nearly everyone expected. During the lead up to the trade deadline pundits were bemoaning the fact the Cubs just trade away all the players who were so important to winning the 2016 World Series. Now pundits are bemoaning the fact the trades were not made!</p>

<p>The reason why trades were made is simple, teams didn&rsquo;t want to pay the price the Cubs were asking for. Contreras is the best catcher in baseball and you don&rsquo;t just give that caliber of player away for some prospects, except maybe a team of prospects. Before Soto became available Contreras was one of the best, if not the best, hitters available. When the Nationals announced they were open to trades, Contreras was no longer the best hitter, he was just the best catcher available. Teams buying simply decided they had needs greater than catcher.</p>

<p>My hope is that the Cubs make a serious attempt to signing Contreras to a new contract during the offseason. Wilson is a player worthy of being the cornerstone to the next great Cubs team, particularly given the additon of the designated hitter. You need leadership to win in any sport, and Wilson provides it to a team of young players and particularly a team with young pitchers. I think Wilson is worth the money he asks for.</p>

			 <p>Consider this. We don&rsquo;t have a Supreme Congress, we don&rsquo;t even have a Supreme President, despite what Trump thinks, but we do have a Supreme Court. By name and by implementation the Supreme Court is the most authoritarian and most dangerous branch of U.S. government. The people who make up this supreme branch of government are not elected but appointed for life! There are no qualifications for appointment, which means those who are appointed are put there because they ideologically agree with those who do the appointing. Nearly every one of the most wrong and most embarrassing moments of U.S. history can be traced back to a Supreme Court decision. And, the Constitution really does not define what it is that the court does nor its power, those were all decided by members of the court itself. No wonder why there are originalists, the origins of the Supreme Court allow them to reign with impunity.</p>

<p>Remember this despite the marketing of the current justices.</p>

			 <p>Much talk regarding the Chicago Cubs probable trades of some of their remaining &ldquo;core&rdquo; players, <a href="https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDFKgntgzECCprcUnAvCztsqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowlPVUMLXBDDD0ocAD?uo=CAUikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGljYWdvdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vc3BvcnRzL2N1YnMvY3QtY2hpY2Fnby1jdWJzLWt5bGUtc2Nod2FyYmVyLXdpbGxzb24tY29udHJlcmFzLWlhbi1oYXBwLTIwMjIwNzI0LTV0MjRyejd6ZHpjdG5sdjJhZWJ1NTVtemRhLXN0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen">Wilson Contreras and Ian Happ</a>, mostly due to the big sell off last year.</p>

<p>One big difference this year, I think, is that the Cubs may be trading away the best catcher in baseball. As good as Bryant, Rizzo, and Baez were you can&rsquo;t say they were the best at their positions. The last time the Cubs cast aside the best in his position was Gregg Maddux, and that trade might have contributed a decade or more of &ldquo;same old Cubs&rdquo; baseball.</p>

<p>It seems to be that Cubs ownership and front office don&rsquo;t understand that there is a difference between turning a franchise around, as they did before 2016 and maintaining the culture that as built during the turnaround. Continual selling and tanking was warranted to turn around a 108 year problem, but that is NOT how you maintain the culture, in fact it destroys what culture that has been built.</p>

<p>The St. Louis Cardinals provides the template of excellence, and the Cubs should know this well since the Cardinals have been their main rival since the beginning of baseball time. The Cardinals prioritize re-signing players, even at the price of overpaying, to maintain their culture.</p>

<p>So far, the current Cubs ownership and front office has not had one major re-signing of player on their roster, and that sends a clear message. The message is sends is that while they might now how to turn a team around, they don&rsquo;t know how to keep it at the top.</p>

<p>Which one is the True American?</p>

<p>My point is not that I agree with or support Pence, but besides Democracy, what is the real difference between he and Trump? Any election that involves Donald Trump is a referendum on the representative Democracy/Republic that is the United States.</p>

<p>If comes down to a question of Democracy or no Democracy, I pick Democracy every. single. time. What about you?</p>

			 <p>Here is a fact of how things work in the United States that people don&rsquo;t seem to like. The only real way change works is when both parties agree to make change. Further, our government is not set up so that the President can do anything he pleases, unlike what Trump might want everyone to think.</p>

<p>Consequently, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democrats-are-disillusioned-over-climate-change/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">blaming Biden</a> for any legislation, like climate change, not passing is B.S. because Congress has to pass legislation first. Guess what, a 50/50 split in the Senate means that enough people from <strong>both</strong> parties have to agree.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this hurdle on change is by design, it&rsquo;s not a bug. It was built, however, on the premise that those elected would actually govern and would not simply vote along party lines even to vote against the best interests of their constituents.</p>

			 <p>Serendipity&hellip;.first I read,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you love people, you see all the good in them, all the Christ in them. God sees Christ, His Son, in us and loves us. And so we should see Christ in others, and nothing else, and love them. There can never be enough of it. There can never be enough thinking about it. St. John of the Cross said that where there was no love, put love and you would take out love. The principle certainly works.</p>

<p>Love and ever more love is the only solution to every problem that comes up. If we love each other enough, we will bear with each other’s faults and burdens. If we love enough, we are going to light that fire in the hearts of others. And it is love that will burn out the sins and hatreds that sadden us. It is love that will make us want to do great things for each other. No sacrifice and no suffering will then seem too much. &ndash; <a href="https://email.cac.org/t/ViewEmail/d/250A9DAE5360473D2540EF23F30FEDED/3F2D2805E5B983A925D77A725F39070E?alternativeLink=False_">Dorothy Day</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I read&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically the lesson is this &ndash; we all suck. Judge us on what we&rsquo;ve done, our actions. Inside we all have ugly thoughts, the question is how much do you act on them. If you think I&rsquo;ve created something interesting, consider that perhaps I could do it again. If I&rsquo;ve been generous maybe I am generous. Maybe you have prejudices. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been dismissed as too old to do what I actually did. Like the time, at a conference, a young person asked if I knew what a podcast was, with a doubtful look on her face as if oh god I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m actually talking to someone this ignorant. &ndash; <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/21/163518.html?title=doYouFeelYoureBetterThanMe#a163835">Dave Winer</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I read about how a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/walgreens-employee-refused-sell-condoms-couple-faith-rcna39165?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">Walgreens employee</a> refused to sell condoms and felt the need to embarass the people trying to buy them.</p>

<p>I continue to be shocked by how people who claim to be Christians make no effort to live out what Jesus taught and thus actually follow him. Richard Rohr says that a Christian is someone who sees Christ in everyone and everything. It is how we love God, by loving what God loves. We all sin, we all have imperfections, and never once did Jesus teach us to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/walgreens-employee-refused-sell-condoms-couple-faith-rcna39165?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">refuse to serve</a> or cast out someone who we think might be sinning. Jesus didn&rsquo;t teach to do whatever we want to prevent sin to happen, because frankly, that is not possible. Jesus taught us to do one thing, follow him, mirror him by loving God through loving what God loves, which is everything!</p>

<p>Honestly, we in the United States must stop using the claim of &ldquo;religious liberty&rdquo; in the name of not doing things one does not want to do. Freedom of religion does not make one superior over another, and the first amendment is more about preventing government (power) from using religion to take freedom away for citizens, as was common practice in the 17th and 18th centuries leading up to the founding of the United States. It is thinking that that the U.S. Constitution is all just about us as individuals that will lead to all of us losing freedom because forget the Constitution&rsquo;s true purpose of restraining government.</p>

<p>So, you would think the forthcoming Google Pixel watch will be that flagship, except that it is not going to have this new Qualcomm chip, instead it will use a Samsung chip. If that Samsung chip doesn&rsquo;t match the performance of Qualcomm&rsquo;s then Google&rsquo;s own watch will not be a flagship.</p>

			 <p>Dear world, or at least anyone who cares, particularly the media. In the United States based on how the Constitution is structured, and how the political parties take advantage of its deficiencies through gerrymandering, lobbying, and campaign financing, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/06/majority-of-public-disapproves-of-supreme-courts-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/">majority opinions do not matter</a>.</p>

<p>The United States is effectively under authoritarian Republican rule overseen by six Supreme Court justices, and it is obviouse the Republicans don&rsquo;t care about any polls that report anything about majority opinion. It only matters what those in power in the Republican party want because they only need Republican votes to stay in power.</p>

<p>Right now what you need to pay attention to is, how are state legislatures structured and are voting districts gerrymandered to favor on particular party over another. If gerrymandering exists, what is being done about it, either through the courts or the existing legistlatures? Citizens need to know their state constitutions and what power they have for referendums, etc.. to overcome the games being played by the parties, particularly Republicans.</p>

<p>In short everyone, in particular the media, need to pay attention to and put bright light on what is going on within the state legistlatures and courts. Every since the last Presidential election Republicans have gamed the systems to gain even more power to basically nullify the will of the people. In many cases, gerrymandering means it won&rsquo;t matter how much this pisses off Democrats and Independents.</p>

<p>Where we are heading toward, as will likely be supported by the current Supeme Court, are <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained">state legistlatures having near absolute power</a> to override the citizens of the state to select Presidents. We will need an equivalent to <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/17th-amendment">the 17th amendment</a> to prevent this from happening because this Supreme Court is going to say it is powerless to do anything about it.</p>

			 <p>In a way, gerrymandering is baked in to the constitution by way of the Electoral College. Consequently, the idea of democrats moving to already blue states <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/07/03/gavin-newsom-florida-gop-attack-ad">like the California governor suggests</a> does not help the cause. Most Republicans will be more than happy to have all Democrats living in California and Massachusetts because they will then easily retain power with less populated but electorally powerful states. The problem right now is that Democrats are too centralized in urban areas. Elections in the United States are not based on population, which is why Republicans win presidencies and can always have a chokehold on the Senate and instill minority rule.</p>

			 <p>How it began, but we don&rsquo;t want to face history thus appear destined to repeat it.</p>

<p>“In 1544, Sepulveda wrote a manuscript justifying the wars against the Amerindians, based largely on what he saw as their inferiority. In it, his thinking is strictly hierarchical; he considers the Spanish Empire, like the Roman Empire, to be entitled to subjugate barbarians in order to civilize them. He regards the Amerindians as inferior to the Spanish, and, following Aristotelian concepts, declares them barbarians, incompetent to govern themselves, and destined to serve. War is necessary to Christianize them.&ldquo;”</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all the fact that the congressmen got around the sticky little problem of Black and Indigenous slavery by defining “men” as “white men,” and for all that it never crossed their minds that women might also have rights, the Declaration of Independence was an astonishingly radical document. <strong>In a world that had been dominated by a small class of rich men for so long that most people simply accepted that they should be forever tied to their status at birth, a group of upstart legislators on the edges of a continent declared that no man was born better than any other.</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Except that far too many in the United States, some who even call themselves Christian, do not believe this. For them there is a natural, divine order that places particular white men above other white men, women, people of color, and everything else on this planet. You find these men in Russia, in the Vatican, and in the United States.</p>

<p>“Four score and seven years ago,” Abraham Lincoln reminded Americans, “our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” In 1863, Lincoln explained, the Civil War was “<strong>testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.</strong>”</p>

<p>Truth is, the test Lincoln describes began the moment it started on July 4, 1776 and has never ended since, particularly after the Civil War. During the 20th century the test expanded beyond the shores of the United States to the entire world. Those who think World War II decisively ended the test are sadly mistaken. The U.S. has been lucky the two world wars were not started or fought within the continent, but I fear the next one will start right here and by our own who cannot abide the disorder that freedom demands.</p>

			 <p>I believe <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/07/01.html#a133321">this will be a growing sentiment</a> about Christianity, and it will be deserved. We are doing things very wrong. Jesus never imposed his teaching on anyone, and he taught his followers to not be like those of the world who lord over others. Words and laws do not transform anything, only a better alternative way is truly transformative, and that is what the kin-dom of God is all about! Anything else is not truly good news.</p>

			 <p>If Republicans were rational, smart, and intune with the majority of the nation that includes the minorities they court, they would reach out to Democrats to craft a bi-partisan bill that wrote the right for all Amercians to chose what happens to and within their bodies, including women&rsquo;s right th chose an abortion up to X number of weeks, in to law. It would undercut a building backlash, make them look like doing something Democrats cannot do, and and showing they can govern.</p>

<p>Of course, this won&rsquo;t happen because Republicans are not rational amd not intune with the nation.</p>

			 <p>I think that the Democratic Party devolved into being ndearly identical to Repubicans when it ended it&rsquo;s relationship with unions in the 90s. We are feeling the consequences of the Bill Clinton years during which Clinton assimilated Republican ideas like NAFTA and welfare reform for the sake of staying in office and thus retaining power. Clinton&rsquo;s argument to Democrats is you have to be in power to affect change, but the consequence was a near equivalency to Republicans. Now Democrats are unable to fight for anything because their real constituency is the same capitalists as the Republicans.</p>

<p>In the past, <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_parties_in_the_United_States#:~:text=There%20are%20over%20420%20registered,parties%2C%20the%20Republicans%20and%20Democrats.">replacement parties</a> would evolve as a fix to when a party goes off the rails, but with the current election laws and the amount of money they involve, the power class has a strangelhold on the United States. The Supreme Court, particularly as it is constructed, is all about returning the country to when capitalists had no restrictions.</p>

What I learned in high school civics is that the United States Constitution established checks and balances against the three branches of government, but what is the real check against the Supreme Court? Lifetime appointments with no qualification requirements and no term limits enables tyranny when five members always make the same decisions. Citizens have no recourse but absorb the brunt of the decisions. Only Congress can impeach or add justices. By definition, that makes SCOTUS the most problematic of the branches of government and why it became the prize of the right.</p>

			 <p>The way of Jesus is not a direct confrontation with evil. Why? It is because when you directly confront evil one becomes evil. We have seen this in modern times with the bombing of abortion clinics, and we will likely see it now in attacks on churches and other “pro-life” institutions. Instead, the way of Jesus, which he called the kingdom of God, is an alternative to evil. In reaction to the bad, it is a practice of the better. One resists evil by loving everyone and seeing them as a part of themselves they do not yet know.</p>

<p>Making abortion illegal will not stop abortion. Why? Because laws are reactive. Laws are not an alternative path rather they are a way for society to hold one accountable. Laws do not stop evil. Nearly all of Paul’s teaching is about this shortcoming of laws. Christianity would know this best if it truly had the mind of Christ and followed Jesus as a movement rather than be a reflection of the human empire that assimilated it into an institution.</p>

<p>Jesus would not be impressed by the overturning of Roe for he would recognize it for what it is, putting new wine in to old wine skins. Jesus would have the church focus on the kingdom, the alternative to evil, a reality on earth as it is in heaven. Today Christian churches may feel victorious, not realizing that while they may have won the battle, they are losing the war as more and more people see it for what is, no different than all the other institutions of man.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What is liberty? It seems to me that at this time the fundamental ideas that birthed the United States is not known or being outright ignored. For me, at it&rsquo;s core liberty is the right to control what happens to me. The Bill of Rights enumerates certain rights that allow me to speak and practice religion without personal consequences like being put in jail.</p>

<p>The Bill of Rights protects me from the government, but it does not give me the right to harm others or take away the rights of others because I disagree, even if the practice of those rights conflicts with my beliefs. The first amendment does NOT give a Christian the right to enforce their beliefs on a Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, or atheist. (I do not see how one can make the argument of life beginning at conception without using religious belief.)</p>

<p>The ninth amendment of the Bill of Rights clearly states that it is not the intent of the Constitution to enumerate all rights of citizens, in fact it says <strong>if the right is not enumerated it is retained by the citizens.</strong></p>

<p>I thought that the ninth amendment and the inalienable, natural, rights declared in the Declaration of Independence were core beliefs of conservatives, but I guess that is not true for that which they do not like.</p>

<p>The Dobbs decision puts men and women at risk. Not only by what Clarence Thomas wrote but also because of the fact that it seems to go out of its way to say there is no right to control what happens to your body. Don&rsquo;t like vaccines? To bad, that don&rsquo;t matter that vaccine is for the greater good. Yes you have to wear that mask. Need welfare? Not going to give it to you until you get that vasectomy because we can&rsquo;t afford paying for more kids.</p>

<p>If we truly held to what liberty means and fully agreed to equal protection under the law, we shouldn&rsquo;t need to have an amendment that gives all citizens the right to choose what happens to and inside their body. It is the amendment we now need it seems and something that everyone should be able to support.</p>

<p>Does liberty truly exist in the United States? Is it really the land of the free? Unfortunately it appears that until this is enumerated in the Constitution certain Supreme Court justices and politicians will not abide nor defend that for which we stand.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Question. If U.S. citizens don’t have the right to choose what happens to their body, couldn’t the government then mandate abortions? Given how everything in the U.S. is based on monetary value, I think it likely that someone will realize forced abortions is cheaper than paying for unwanted children. Taking away protections from government has far greater risk to liberty than acknowledging rights, which I think is fundamental to the ninth amendment.</p>

I am a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan and the World Series did not change my loyalty nor expectations. I am grateful for 2016 but don&rsquo;t expect them to win every year and not surprised they aren&rsquo;t competitive this year. Last year they subtracted much more than they added, and the one big add is really an unknown.</p>

			 <p>While I like micro.blog&rsquo;s bookshelf that produces the Reading section of this site, one thing I don&rsquo;t like is that I don&rsquo;t have control over the order of the list of books in <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/finished-reading/">the Finished Reading page</a>.

<p>I also track my reading in outline (OPML) files using Little Outliner. While I have indivudual pages for 2020 and 2021 today it occurred to me that I might be able to produce a master index using an OPML file with parent nodes that include the other files, which I have done and is now accessibe via <a href="http://books.frankm.info">http://books.frankm.info</a>.</p>

<p>I’m trying to understand why committee members are not gripped by these realities. After more than a century of relative democratic stability maybe it’s hard for some people to imagine precisely how the fits of political violence that bedevil other nations could hit our shores. Maybe the committee members are imprisoned in the categories set by past investigation committees — Watergate and 9/11.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the answer is the same as to the question of why the Attorney General has not already filed charges against Trump. Fear of retaliation. Fear that doing so will be what pushes us over the cliff towards that civil war.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2022/05/25/you-will-hear.html">Last week I wrote</a> about how the problem with gun violence in the U.S. is not so much with those in political office as much as it is with those who keep electing those people in to office. I should have noted then about how gerrymandering, which is being completely ignored by the Supreme Court, is contributing to the battle between the states that frankly is destroying democracy. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/07/gerrymandering-abortion-roe-v-wade-ohio?utm_source=pocket_mylist">The Guardian addresses this topic</a> in terms of abortion, but the same applies to guns.. It points to the hypocrisy of a Supreme Court that says such decisions should be made by legislatures but does nothing to maintain fairness of representation that is necessary for a functioning democracy.</p>

<p>For evil to flourish, good men forget who they are. They forget the ideals they once swore to give their very lives for.

They come to see education and intellect as &ldquo;elitism&rdquo; and they begin to regard duty and the obligations of civilization itself as oppression. They raise up ignorance, hate, and especially violent rage as strengths and sneer in contempt at compassion, charity, and selflessness.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling <a href="https://www.stonekettle.com/2015/06/bang-bang-sanity.html">the article I linked to yesterday</a> that makes suggestions for practical gun safety based on the NRA&rsquo;s safety rules. And I suspect that one may think to themselves, how would gun safety laws help decrease the amount of gun violence in the United States. And here from the article is the point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well written laws are about pragmatism.</p>

<p>For example, we all know that laws against drinking and driving won’t stop drunk driving, but they weren’t intended to. We know it’s going to happen. People are going to drink and drive and kill themselves and each other. We know we can’t eliminate it completely. That’s the pragmatism part.</p>

<p>Instead, drunk driving laws were intended to do two things, 1) give us legal recourse as a society, 2) make us responsible for our antisocial behavior – which in turn leads over time to a change in culture.</p>

<p>And that change significantly, measurably, reduced drinking and driving and provably saved lives and made American roads a safer place for all of us.</p>

<p>But, and this is important so pay attention, here’s what those laws didn’t do: they didn’t keep those of us who take responsibility for our own actions from 1) drinking, or 2) driving (note the operative word here is or).</p>

<p>And that’s the answer.</p>

<p>We need gun laws that give society legal recourse by making each gun owner/user personally accountable for their own actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most sane people, pro gun law or anti gun law, will at least acknowledge that gun violence is way out of control in the United States. We have a societal problem. The problem has been getting worse for a decade and no laws have been passed to address it. What message, what permission, does the very act of not doing anything have on society? I think it says, the current state is ok. Keep on with the killing no matter whether it is in a school, a church, or a movie theatre.</p>

			 <p>You will hear pundits quote polling that suggests a majority of citizens want tougher gun control laws, like you hear that a majority of citizens do not want abortion to be illegal. While that information might be true, it does not reflect how a bill becomes a law in the United States. In short, that polling information is really useless because laws are not passed the U.S. as a nation.</p>

<p>Every state has two senators, no matter how many citizens it has, and if not more than 60 Senators are willing to vote in favor of a law, the law will not be passed, even if it passes the House which more accurately reflects the population of the United States. So, the right polling should be per state.</p>

<p>We tend to obviscate by classifying states as red or blue, when in reality is you have states that are &ldquo;pro no restraints on guns over loss of life&rdquo; and other states that are &ldquo;pro restraints on guns to prevent loss of life.&rdquo; Citizens in these states who keep re-electing Senators over and over again have created the current situation.</p>

<p>So today, right now the question isn&rsquo;t, what is the Unites States going to do. The real question is, what are the citizens of the state of Texas, who keep re-electing Ted Cruz over and over again, going to do? I am not optimistic.</p>

<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/25/ted-cruz-lawmakers-money-gun-rights-groups">no matter how much money the NRA gives Ted Cruz</a>, the NRA is not casting votes for him, it&rsquo;s the citizens in the state of Texas who cast those votes. Yes, the NRA bought all the past votes but that only works because Cruz is in office, and that only happens because more citizens of Texas vote for him than someone else who will vote for common sense gun laws.</p>

			 <p>Every time another mass gun shooting takes place we direct our anger at lawmakers who refuse to pass gun control laws. Unfortunately, that anger is misplaced. How many times has citizens in the state of Kentucky re-elected Mitch McConnell after a shooting takes place? Truth is, the citizens in each state with Senators refusing to pass gun control laws that keep re-electing those Senators are the true people at fault. Citizens, you and I. Clearly, the citizens of Kentucky prefer the current situation as do far too many citizens in too many states, including the ones in which the shootings take place. <strong>Lawmakers do nothing because they know they do not have do anything, none of them are at risk of not being re-elected because they don&rsquo;t pass gun control laws.</strong> End of story. It&rsquo;s all on us, and that includes parents of children the same age as those killed yesterday.</p>

			 <p>Dear Constitutional Fundamentalists, Supreme Court Justics and conservative Republicans. How do you reconcile the claim that the government cannot mandate vaccines on the basis of protecting the public good because of your right to decide what happens to your body, a right apparently not natural and not explicitly in the Constitiution according to SCOTUS, and your claim that the government can mandate that a pregnant woman give birth to a baby?</p>

<p>I mean, there is liikely going to be another pandemic in the future that could result in millions of dead people due to the inactions of others, either we, all genders, all races, all humans, being equal, have the right to privacy that provides us the right to decide what happens to and inside our bodies, or we do not. You cannot have it both ways.</p>

<p>Or is it that we are not all equal and thus do not deserve equal protection under the law?</p>

			 <p>Is recognizing rights of citizens in the United States a bad thing? My understanding of the United States Constitution is that its purpose is to prevent the Federal government from becoming tyrannical by narrowing its power to enumerated rights. The Constitution does not exist to define the rights of citizens and <strong>I am pretty sure Madison did not imagine that the Bill of Rights defined the only rights of U.S. citizens.</strong> Therefore it seems to me that the very act of removing rights from citizens through declaring that SCOTUS decisions granted rights not provided for in the Constitution is the exact opposite of an originalist understanding of the Constitution. Roe v. Wade restrains the Federal government from taking a women&rsquo;s right of autonomy over their own body, a right by the way that many of been claiming is the reason why things like &ldquo;mask mandates&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccine mandates&rsquo; are not constitutional.</p>

I think the wealthy like Musk are concerned about the negative reputation toward and potential cancel culture of the wealthy. Owning Twitter assures he can&rsquo;t get kicked off the platform no matter what he writes, so he can freely write things like how bad a wealth tax would be. In other words, owning Twitter is about controlling the narrative for Musk. Also, if Musk owns Twitter Trump will be back on Twitter.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve received my new <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/ipad-mini-6">iPad Mini 6</a> and I am working through setting it up. I opted to transfer apps, settings and data directly from the iPad Mini 5. First hoop I had to jump is getting through the  update to iPadOS 15.4.1, which took several minutes to download and update.</p>

<p>Next thing I notice is that all of widgets on the home screen are all blank white boxes with no obvious fix. First I restarted the iPad, but that didn&rsquo;t fix the problem. I then realized that while I see all the app icons, the apps are not installed so I need to start up each of the apps associated with the widgets.</p>

<p>I basically have to reinstall every app I use which is a really painful process that I cannot believe Apple foists upon users. And the process is made worse by the spotty nature of the App Store that right now is refusing to install apps.</p>

<p>So, it is going to probably take several days for me to get this Mini fully up to speed.</p>

Imagine he owns Twitter and then runs for President of the United States. Would he be forced to divest? A precident was set with Trump. If the sale proceeds there should be conditions that if he were to run for office he would have to divest, but I doubt that will happen.</p>

<p>In my eyes a Trump versus Musk Republican primary is lose/lose, but I can see that happen. I think it says a lot when the oligarchs are seeking the office.</p>

<p>I also think the reaction and any action if the sale happens may reinforce <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2022/04/13/ive-read-jonathan.html">my view</a> of how American society is addicted to wealth and power.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve read Jonathan Haidt&rsquo;s essay, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">Why the Past 10 Years of American Life Have Been Uniquely Stupid</a>. I can summarize Haidt by saying the algorithms in social media are destroying our democratic society. We have devolved in to the very things that James Madison feared when writing the Constitution.</p>

<p>While Haidt makes many good points I don&rsquo;t think he gets to the root cause, which I think is our acceptance that it is ok for corporations to make money from addiction.</p>

<p>In the United States we want to put all the blame of one&rsquo;s problem on themselves. Thus, the only problem with addiction is the addict and the consequences they bring upon themselves. Too many industries like  technology, food, service/fast food, alcohol, health, and pharamceutical all profit from addiction. You should note the fundamental nature of these industries.</p>

<p>Even after lawsuits and public trials against the tobacco industry that exposed it knew nicotine is addictive and knew it causes cancer and yet still made money off of selling cigarettes, we give every industry with a business model that uses addiction to maximize profit and wealth a free pass. In the United States it is ok for someone to make a buck off the death of another, and somehow there are even &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; in this country who consider themselves pro-life.</p>

<p>In the beginning Facebook and Twitter did not make money, it wasn&rsquo;t until they introduced algorithms to force content in front of users that they began making money. Research is showing the algorithms are optimized for addiction. And still I think you will find many people in the United States point the finger at people who use these networks as solely to blame and unwilling to restrict Facebook or Twitter from making money because we believe nobody should be restricted from making money.</p>

<p>The United States was founded upon the basic concept of freedom, and frankly that concept is no longer the prime directive of the United States. Today the United States is entirely driven by capitalism and the prime directive is to make a few people very rich, and a few rich people don&rsquo;t need nor really want democracy, they just want the citiizens to be free to spend more and more money on their products.</p>

<p>Everybody knows money is the problem, but like an addict that just can&rsquo;t do what is in their best interests, nobody is going to do anything about it. Sadly, like most addicts we know, I don&rsquo;t think our country will seriously address our problems until we hit rock bottom, and I fear for what such a bottom will look like for a country that has accepted children being killed in schools and people in power acting to overthrow the government.</p>

<p>I remember a time when shortstops were considered the worst batter in the lineup and that didn&rsquo;t matter because shortstops were considered the best athlete and most important defensive player on the team. Ozzie Smith didn&rsquo;t make is his mark at the plate, he was known as the Wizard because of his defense. I always felt too much attention is paid to Baez&rsquo;s inconsistency at the plate and not enough value placed on his defense, which I think is worth enough to absorb his bat.</p>

<p>Baez was not the problem in the Cubs lineup, the problem was that everyone else in the lineup was not much better. Put Baez in a lineup with other players who make contact and get on base and you can live with his strikeouts, and revel in his ability in the big moments. I think in some ways Baez is like Brett Farve, high risk and high reward. The defense, and in particular Reggie White, made Farve who he was for the Packers because it could overcome his interceptions. Put Farve on the Detroit Lions and he is not a hall of fame player.</p>

<p>I am happy that even though Javier is no longer playing for the Cubs, he is playing for a team in my area that is on TV every day. Baez is the type of player you tune in just to watch, regardless of your interest in the team, much like Cabrera was in his prime. Tiger fans need to remember the incredible plays that he has already made in four games when he strikes out in that crticial moment in July because it will happen and he will still be worth every bit of money he is paid.</p>

			 <p>Today the Chicago Cubs, well actually mostly the Cub&rsquo;s farm system, will play the last 2022 spring training game and will go in to the new season with <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cubs/standings/spring-training">a winning spring training record</a>. Of course, nobody wins a World Series in spring training, even if my attendance at the 2016 spring training might have propelled the Cubs to win it all that year.</p>

<p>It looks like the Cubs have improved, and I expect they will be competitive enough to make them interesting to watch. One concerning sign from the  spring is they allowed more runs than scored, and run scoring (offense) is the big question mark.</p>

			 <p>I am a Chicago Cubs fan who lives in southeast Michigan. When I first moved here in 1989 I couldn&rsquo;t watch the Cubs unless they were on national TV, so I did take an interest in watching the local Detroit Tigers broadcast. When the MLB.tv and MLB At Bat app became available I could again watch every Cubs game and therefore I don&rsquo;t watch as much of the Detroit Tigers. I also tend to not watch the national broadcast games.</p>

<p>All of the above is background to me wondering just how successful the streaming of &ldquo;national broadcast&rdquo; games will be on Apple TV. Fourty years ago there were more national broadcast of baseball games at a time when there were no regional nor local broadcasts and no Internet streaming. Baseball does not have the same national draw as the NFL and the Cubs play every Friday. I doubt this will happen, but I&rsquo;ll be really mad if they don&rsquo;t stream the games in MLB.tv on Fridays.</p>

<p>So, for myself, the only time I will watch the Friday night games on Apple TV is when the Cubs play, and I suspect most other people will do the same. I just don&rsquo;t see this working out well for Apple, particularly when Apple decides to block access to only Apple TV subscribers. Right now people do not subscribe to Apple TV to watch baseball. MLB will probably be ok because I am sure they are getting paid by Apple regardless of the number of viewers.</p>

<p>In the meantime I read that the NFL might start their own streaming service, so I wonder whether I will be able to see more Green Bay Packer games?</p>

			 <p>“The Christian faith is different from what the world teaches. The Christian faith is not “seeing is believing,” but rather, “believing is seeing.” We must open our eyes and hearts and see Jesus’s presence in our lives. We need to see him in the places that we dare not to look and dare not to think about.”</p>

			 <p>War should not be <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/25/opinions/watching-ukraine-war-on-screen-hemmer/index.html">watched or consumed as entertainment</a>. One ought to consider how it is that one or a few people can make the decision to start a war with seemingly little to no regard for loss of human life and the suffering it causes. I think at the heart of it is the sin of supremacy that convinces that the other&rsquo;s life is not valuable nor legitimate.</p>

<p>Even in democracies, as we know all too well in the United States, one man or woman has the power to wage war.  We have decided that expediency is so important we must empower one human to such power, a power that frankly we should never allow to just one human.</p>

<p>The power to wage war and it&rsquo;s consequences is why character matters so much when deciding which human should be elected President of the United States. Anyone who treats the power to wage war as a political tool should never be allowed to hold the office.</p>

			 <p>The problem with our politics today is that it is obsessed with the past. Conservatives want to go back to the “glory days” of the past (surely this what is meant by “Make America Great <strong>Again</strong>”) and Liberals want go back and fix the past. (surely cancel culture drives this). Both poles have an unhealthy view of history, it is neither to return to nor fix but to learn from. The majority of us are busy dealing with the present and see the obsession with the past as less than helpful.</p>

			 <p>Something is fundamentally wrong in a democracy that has all the energy around laws to restrict voting rather than expand voting. We should be embarrassed that so few people actually vote, but as has been the case since the beginning the system is built to be run by an elite few. It is said the United States is a republic or a representative democracy, but who is really represented and who is not represented is the metastasis destroying the country from the inside out.</p>

<p>An individual should not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instead of seeing versions of hearsay (non-institutional systems of news and analysis) as damaging institutional systems, we could choose to see the hearsay system itself as the thing under attack. That is, in the age of social media, a valuable system of non-institutional knowledge is increasingly gameable and gamed, rendered useless by a variety of threats and incentives that are polluting not the institutional space, but the hearsay space.</p>

			 <p>In the United States, democracy is less about the form of government and more about an aspiration. The idea of true equality of all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation was simply not comprehensible to the U.S. founders or their contemporaries. Interestingly, I think James Madison recognized the imperfections of the United States when he wrote these words in the preamble to the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We the People of the United States, in Order <strong>to form a more perfect Union</strong>, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me a &ldquo;more perfect union&rdquo; is not a declaration of an end state but rather a recognition that we can continue to become better. In other words, Madison expected the United States in 2022 to be more perfect than the United States in 1780 because the Constitution provides the framework for that improvement. It does this by providing for amendments that improve upon the original work.</p>

			 <p>The scary reality is that the future of the Republic may very much ride on the Republican Presidential Primaries in 2024. The Republican party enabled Trump to become President thus only it,  or better said only it&rsquo;s corporate and wealthy backers, can prevent him from being their nominee in 2024. In short, most of the anti-Trump, anti-fascist rhetoric is coming from Democrats, but they don&rsquo;t have the real power to prevent it from happening again, particularly when the country is split 50/50 between the two parties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, unless GOP voters are polarized against the extreme right, and turnout for Republican primary contests increases dramatically, the party could continue to be a vehicle for building this hard-right base at the state level and in congressional races. The poll numbers certainly suggest that these forces have plenty of room to organize and recruit. <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2021/01/capitol-building-riot-business-trump?utm_source=pocket_mylist">source</a></p>

			 <p>Another lesson of COVID is the reality that while scientists and doctors know a lot about the human body, there is much, particularly when it comes to diseases, that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/do-post-vaccination-infections-improve-immunity/621172/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">they just don&rsquo;t know</a>.

			 <p>My guess is that many of us view this day differently, and yet others think it overwrought. To me the heart of the matter is the elevation of individualism to a religion. You might call it American Christianity. Individualism by default creates dualism, winners and losers, true Americans and not true Americans, and it does not see the value of the &ldquo;public&rdquo; (we) except only to the extent that it benefits me. Surely this is the lesson of COVID, and I think it is the true lesson of January 6, 2020.</p>

<p>So I think that it’s better to ask people: “Based on your own self-interest as you yourself define your self-interest, how do you expect this to work out? How do you expect the world to look in 2060 or 2070 or 2080? And how do you expect to shield yourself and your family from the world?”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think a lot of people&rsquo;s answer to the above is, I don&rsquo;t care, I&rsquo;ll be dead. We have been conditioned for short term thinking over the last five decades.</p>

			 <p>I am only aware of one country in the world that took conscious steps to address the cancer of supremacy, that country is South Africa. It&rsquo;s path toward the task of overcoming supremacy was long and likely incomplete but would probably not have been taken up at all if not for Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu.</p>

<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/desmond-tutu-dead-a0cec6cddaa5cf2a996df8550a72479c">News of Tutu&rsquo;s death</a> makes me wonder how he saw the United States. Tutu had the wisdom to know that the antidote to supremacy is oneness, ubuntu. Supremacy cannot be shunned as it will simply continue lurking in the shadows. The only way to eliminate contempt is to see everyone as a part of me I do not yet know.</p>

<p>I feel as though the entire United States needs to be in a 12 step program. We cannot begin to overcome that which we don&rsquo;t even acknowledge. We hide our addiction with our liberties. The <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/">amount of death that we have grown to accept</a>, the amount of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/28/us/denver-shooting-officer-injured/index.html">senseless loss of life we tolerate</a> are not signs of a great nation or society.</p>

<p>The United States is leading the world into a third year of a pandemic that will continue to take more lives unnecessarily, and United States continues to lead the world in gun violence. All we are doing is managing to get by for just one more day. Apparently we have not yet hit bottom even after children are gun down in schools.</p>

<p>South Africa did not start to overcome the addiction of supremacy known as apartheid until it consciously did something about it. Any expert on addiction will tell you that no person can be made to overcome their addiction, the addict must decide for themselves they want to live. We, the citizens of the United States of America need to decide whether this republic handed down to us is something we want to keep, and that takes all of us to take a long look at ourselves and see us as we are rather than as how we keep telling ourselves.</p>

I am one of those people who sleeps with their phone on their bed stand, it&rsquo;s basically my alarm clock. In the past, when in the dark always on display would dim but stay on enough to be seen and I woke up I could see the time. For the last several nights now the display has turned off and I don&rsquo;t know why.

			 <p>As noted previously, I have a new Macbook Air and I am just getting used to using Mac OS. When at my desk I am connecting the Macbook to a 32 inch BenQ monitor via a USB-C dock and because I am using the Macbook&rsquo;s keyboard, the monitors are arranged in System Preferences Displays settings as vertically stacked, with the external display above the internal display. I have the external display set as the primary but what has been frustrating is that the OS X dock doesn&rsquo;t automatically move up to the primary display. I cannot believe that <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141493/moving-dock-between-vertically-arranged-displays-in-os-x-mavericks-and-later/175910">I have to move the mouse to the bottom left of the external monitor</a> to get the dock to move when OS X seems to be smart enough to know which menu bar is active on which display; seems to me on which ever screen the menu bar is active that is the display that should have the dock. Testing shows that the issue only seems to be with vertical stacking of the displays (so I move the mouse up/down between displays) and not when the monitors are horizontally arranged (move the mouse right/left between displays).</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593230770">No Cure for Being Human: And Other Truths I Need to Hear</a> by Kate Bowler 📚 The writing in this book is all too relatable to me. A quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While I believe that there may be rich meaning at every crossroad in our lives—each meeting and departure, car accident or chance encounter—I do not believe that God will provide for every need or prevent every sorrow. From my hospital room, I see no master plan to bring me to a higher level, guarantee my growth, or use my cancer to teach me. Good or bad, I will not get what I deserve. Nothing will exempt me from the pain of being human.</p>

<p>Most of us know and are faced daily with what is to be human but spend little time thinking about Being.</p>

			 <p>The more <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-you-can-do-about-omicron-and-any-future-covid-19-variants/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">articles I read about COVID19</a> the more frustrated I get with the lack of availability of affordable rapid testing in the United States. Throughout the pandemic we have suffered from the desire for certainty and perfection. Perfection is the enemy of the better. Rapid tests won&rsquo;t detect all cases, so they don&rsquo;t guarantee one is not infected, BUT if a rapid test is positive you then clearly know you are a threat to spreading the infection to others and should definitely stay home, which is more information than the average person has before they walk out the door.</p>
