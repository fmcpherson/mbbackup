<p>In 1806, on the advice of Vice President Aaron Burr (who thought it redundant), the Senate dropped the “previous question” — a motion to end debate and bring an item up for immediate vote — from its rules. Without a motion to call the previous question, however, an individual senator could, in theory, hold the floor indefinitely.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Given the number of <a href="https://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pis</a> I have, you might get the impression that I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture">maker</a>, but I am not. I&rsquo;ve just been enamored by these small, inexpensive single board computers. The closest I&rsquo;ve come so far to a real project is what I call my desk clock, which is a Pi installed behind a five inch monitor that displays Chromium kiosk mode with a screen I configure using <a href="https://dakboard.com">Dakboard</a>.</p>

<p>I originally built the desk clock using a Raspberry Pi 2 that stopped working a few weeks ago. This past weekend tried to troubleshoot the problem. First I built a new SD card and it seemed to boot fine, but after a few more tests I found that the USB WiFi dongle was not reliably connecting to the home network, so I decided to re-purpose a Pi 3 that was on my desk for the desk clock.</p>

<p>To retain the backup and archive functions that Pi 3 was performing, I moved it&rsquo;s SD card to a Pi 3b+ and then built a new SD card for the desk clock, except this time I cheated by using a pre-built image that dakboard provides.</p>

<p>The net result is that I now have one less Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk. Last night as I was putting things away I found another Pi 3 I already had been storing, which if I had known about would have simplified things, but not resulted in one less Pi on my desk.</p>

<p>For a summary of my Raspberry Pis, expand the <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/techThatIUse.opml#1594992722000">Every Day Tech</a> branch of <a href="http://tech.frankm.info">my Technology outline</a>.</p>

         	<p>Just found that <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> also removed the copy link from the sharing option in the web app. I am beginning to think that I need to start considering other reading options. I could revert back to Instaper, but had grown frustrated with it&rsquo;s lack of development.</p>

<p>While I am venting about Pocket, I have a feature request. Provide readers the option that when they are reading an article and then archive that the next article in the list is loaded rather than returning me to the list. The current process really slows down the reading flow for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religious evangelicals may look at these numbers and think, “This is not what the term evangelical means.” The assumption is that the term describes those who place high value on the teachings of the Bible and strive to evangelize other people into their faith. However, that understanding of the term seems to be fading, replaced with a more amorphous concept that melds together religious doctrine and an affinity for conservative politics that experts are only beginning to understand now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is a bug, not a feature. One can argue that the assimilation of Christianity into the Roman Empire in 313 huge negative consequences on Christianity, and it probably was not good for empire either.</p>

<p>Secular power always, always, seeks to consolidate power with religion.</p>

         	<p>What&rsquo;s ironic is that every person arrested for the insurrection on the U.S. Capital on January 6, 2021 will expect, and demand, that everyone provide, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence">the presumption of innocence</a>, which requires the accuser to prove by providing evidence in court that the accused commited a crime. Yet, these people wanted state legislatures, the Supreme Court, or Congress to nullify the election results based on their accusuation of voter fraud.</p>

<p>The point being, the people storming the Capital really weren&rsquo;t defending the Constitution nor do they really want to live in the world they think they are fighting for. Presumption of innocence means they have the possibility of not being put in jail by a force greater than themselves and that same presumption of innocence might be the only thing that saved the Republic, this time.</p>

         	<p>The conclusion I reach after reading the New Yorker story, &ldquo;<a href="https://app.getpocket.com/read/3230122334">Among the Insurrectionists</a>&rdquo; is that at the least we live in two Americas, if not in two realities. I also don&rsquo;t see a way for any real resolution because the people described in the article cannot be reasoned with, they only want their way. Democrats can’t fix this, and while Republicans have the only chance, even those who do not &ldquo;comply&rdquo; will not be listened too.</p>

<p>For me, it comes down to principles. Republicans had principles at one time, such as demonstrated by John McCain when he pushed back when someone wanted to brand Obama a Muslim, implying all Muslims are enemies.</p>

<p>The fact that so many Republican members of Congress abetted the insurrection is proof to me that the lust for power and having their own way is far stronger than the principles of democracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt established business regulation, a basic social safety net, and government-funded infrastructure in the 1930s to combat the Great Depression that had laid ordinary Americans low, one right-wing senator wrote to a colleague: “This is despotism, this is tyranny, this is the annihilation of liberty…. The ordinary American is thus reduced to the status of a robot. The president has not merely signed the death warrant of capitalism, but has ordained the mutilation of the Constitution, unless the friends of liberty, regardless of party, band themselves together to regain their lost freedom.</p>

<p>Seems to me a problem is that we don&rsquo;t have common agreement on the core principles on the founding of the United States as stated in <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992">the preamble to U.S. Constitution</a>, particularly, &ldquo;promote the general Welfare.&rdquo;</p>

         	<p>Jill Lepore&rsquo;s article, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/18/whats-wrong-with-the-way-we-work">What’s Wrong with the Way We Work</a>, is a really important read. I think it gets at a lot of things that people who are unhappy are dealing with. Here is one of the important points:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Outside of agriculture, more than one in three working Americans belonged to a union in the fifties. In 1983, one in five belonged to a union; by 2019, only one in ten did. Union membership declined; income inequality rose. To explain this, Suzman points to the “Great Decoupling” of the nineteen-eighties: <strong>wages and economic growth used to track each other.</strong> From about 1980, in the United States, the G.D.P. kept growing, even as real wages stagnated.

         	<p>Cancel culture is not the way to handle differences in a democracy. It creates victims from people who are not and leads to more polarization. Further we shouldn’t react to a failure to prepare for dangerous behavior planned out in the open by forcing it under ground. The problem was not that the actions of January 6, 2021 where planned on social networks, the problem was the failure in recognizing the plans as a real threat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s absolutely plausible to me that even more Republicans would have joined this blatant attempt to overturn the election and that their base would mostly have been fine with that. The (self)-coup train wasn’t something that was just for show; it just wasn’t close enough to work this time.</p>

<p>Which is why there must be consequences on the Republican party. Either it needs to do some serious cleanup beyond Trump, or it needs to be further ostracized.</p>

<p>Among my oldest memories are from the seventies watching the World Series, which seemed to always be the New York Yankees versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, with my grandfather and grandmother. Even though my grandfather had strokes that left him speechless he was my father figure and so these are fond memories. My grandfather grew up in Milwaukee and so a fan of the Milwaukee Brewers but the Yankees were the villain and the Dodgers the hero for us during these games. Of course Lasorda was the manager of the Dodgers during those games, so news of his passing brought back these memories today.</p>

         	<p>It&rsquo;s amusing and sad to finally see so many <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/07/politics/trump-hill-republicans-move-on/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29">Republicans jump off the sinking ship</a> after it hit the iceberg. All through the last four years my question to Republicans has been, what is your line that Trump could not cross? We found the line was literaly no less than an attempt to overthrow the government of the United States. And these are people who call themselves patriots? If they really want to do the right thing they should resign.</p>

<p>The thing is, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter now. What&rsquo;s going to matter is when in four years and the Republican Presidential primaries start does the party push back against Trump and any who follow his playbook, or do they do all the same things again? It already started when Congress finally reviewed and accpeted the Electoral College results.</p>

<p>At this point I think the lust for supremacy is what Republicans are all about. They could not take a principaled stand until literally forced to by an attempted coup. I for one right now cannot imagine how I can ever trust anyone who is Republican and desires the power of federal office. We cannot let Republicans re-frame the story in a way that does not make them culpable in what happened on January 6, 2021, for they built the platform upon which Trump and his followers spoke and acted, starting with birtherism.</p>

         	<p>What ought to be clear to Congress, the DOJ, to the Armed Forces, and anyone in power that is not associated with Trump is that IF Trump is NOT removed from office now then at a minimum they must prepare to act swiftly to respond to the actions of this rogue President. Anything less is at best negligence. Trump is a hostile and the threat he poses needs to be taken seriously. No more &ldquo;what harm can he do&rdquo; <a href="https://nitter.net/zeynep/status/1347246007126536193#m">attitude</a> from anyone in power.

         	<p>As a long time blogger I wonder some time about how blogging has contributed to the current state of politics in the United States. Blogging made it easy to publish to the web and thus made it easy for nearly everyone to publish their opinions. The problem it seems to me is that we have begun to value opinions more than facts or even truth. Trump and his supporters are so firm in their opinion that the election was stolen from him that they think their opinion is fact, and that because something could happen, it did happen, which is the definition of a conspiracy theory.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I am using <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/raspberry-pi-4">a Raspberry Pi 4</a> (daenerys) as <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/using-the-raspberry-pi4-as-a-remote-desktop">my desktop personal computer during the work day</a>, which I access from my work provided computer <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2021/01/04/the-official-images.html">using VNC</a>. By using this Pi 4 I can access the Internet from my desk without going through the corporate Internet proxy.</p>

<p>I built daenerys in <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">a Flirc case</a>, which looks really nice and provides passive cooling, and it boots from a SSD in an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inateck-Inch-Drive-Enclosure-External/dp/B00FCLG65U/ref=pd_lpo_147_t_0/144-8444920-6603364?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B00FCLG65U&amp;pd_rd_r=e1377215-a1a4-4ae0-ba6c-f447c6cb3705&amp;pd_rd_w=AoENj&amp;pd_rd_wg=Awfxl&amp;pf_rd_p=16b28406-aa34-451d-8a2e-b3930ada000c&amp;pf_rd_r=P77HN0BMNZCMMG2TEZX4&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=P77HN0BMNZCMMG2TEZX4">Inateck case</a>. The SSD gets power from the Pi and so under normal load I would see temperatures hover around 55 degrees celcius, which is well below the 85 degree threshold that causes the CPU to throttle down.</p>

<p>Over the holiday <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/myTechProjects.opml#1608128858000">I built another Raspberry Pi 4</a> (arya) in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MazerPi-Raspberry-Cooling-Heatsink-Model/dp/B07W3ZMVP1">a MazerPi case</a> that has a fan. The fan draws power from the GPIO pins and has two modes, high speed if plugged in to the 5v pin (PIN 2) and low speed if plugged in to the 3.3v pin (PIN1). To complete the picture, ground is plugged in th PIN 6.</p>

<p>The MazerPi fan just stays on all the time, I am not aware of a way to control the fan so that it only comes on when a certain temperature threshold is past. I first plugged the fan in to one of the 5v pins and found it loud enough to be heard, although not terribly loud. When using high speed mode the CPU temperatures were in the mid to high 30 degree range under normal load. When I ran Octane 2 it then crossed 40 degrees.</p>

<p>I decided to try the low speed mode, which is quiet enough to not hear unless one concentrates. Temperatures where in the 40 to 45 degree range, which is plenty good.</p>

<p>At this point the thought occurred to me that it probably makes sense to use the case with the fan for the Pi that I am going to use every day rather than in one I am going to use as an accessory and thus I removed the SD card from arya and plugged in the SSD from daenerys and it booted right up. (BTW, note that in reality a computer host name is associated with the boot drive and not the actual computer, so daenerys is really the 250 GB SSD drive while arya is a 256 GB SD card.)</p>

<p>Finally, I decided I wanted to try overclocking daenerys, which given the fan should be safe. Normal speed for this Pi4 board is 1.5 GHz, so I decided to overclock it to 2 GHz. Performance is noticably faster. At 1.5 Ghz daenery&rsquo;s Octane 2 score is 8098 and at 2.0 Ghz the score is 9777. Neither score is fantastic, but good enough for the type of web browsing that I do.</p>

<p>When you overclock a CPU it will run hotter and that can cause failures. In the MazerPi, with the fan in low speed mode, and the Pi 4 booting from a SSD and overclocked to a max frequency of 2 GHz and a minimum frequency of 1 GHz I am seeing temperatures ranging from 46 degrees to 55 degress, which is about the same as well using the Pi in the Flirc case but not overclocked.</p>

<p>The net result is that have &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; daenerys to a faster processing speed that provides better performance while maintaining a good CPU temperature and so far after one full working day it has been stable. The MazerPi case cost only $8 and is easy to assemble with help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_stCwXmRiA">a video</a> I found on YouTube.</p>

Today I learned that RealVNC Server is now available for the beta but has to be enabled via the terminal using raspi-config, so I switched. I don&rsquo;t know whether anyone else will find this useful, but it feels like RealVNC is faster than x11vnc.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting that <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/_1jAuCly20Y/index.html">CNN is airing a documentary</a> about the first modern outsider elected President before Trump, Jimmy Carter. When I think back about Carter&rsquo;s years as President I think what happened is that he showed us reality that we did not like very much. It&rsquo;s no wonder then that he lost to a professional actor and that in many ways we have been living in a delusion that has been amplified by Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would the rock-and-roll set flock to a man who, as president, is remembered today as being a micro-managing, straight-arrow engineer who failed to inspire or understand leadership? The reason is that in his prime, Jimmy Carter was cool. He championed a kind of political populism that was extremely attractive to Americans disillusioned with Washington in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. Sick and tired of elected officials who betrayed them, they found a refreshing change in Carter, a former peanut farmer who was seen as an anti-establishment outsider. As Bishop Michael Curry recalls in the documentary, &ldquo;We were coming out of the Watergate era and looking &hellip;to be a country of integrity again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with the quote above from Bishop Curry is that I am not sure the United States has ever been a &ldquo;country of integrity.&rdquo; I think some of the founders had this aspiration but failed to see the log in their eye of supremacy is the forms of slavery and colonialism.</p>

<p>To me the greatest irony of the Trump presidency has been that part of the campaign slogan, &ldquo;Make America Great&rdquo; is a good and right aspiration but demands a degree of introspection on what is greatness and who determines greatness.</p>

<p>P.S. I observe that it seems all one term presidents of my life time became one term because that were a mirror reflecting ourselves that we did not like very much. Our egos much prefer the myths of our false selves than the reality of our true selves.</p>

         	<p>“The symbol of Christmas—what is it? It is the rainbow arched over the roof of the sky when the clouds are heavy with foreboding. It is the cry of life in the newborn babe when, forced from its mother’s nest, it claims its right to live. It is the brooding Presence of the Eternal Spirit making crooked paths straight, rough places smooth, tired hearts refreshed, dead hopes stir with newness of life. It is the promise of tomorrow at the close of every day, the movement of life in defiance of death, and the assurance that love is sturdier than hate, that right is more confident than wrong, that good is more permanent than evil.” — Howard Thurman <a href="https://email.cac.org/t/ViewEmail/d/71791578E21F49DA2540EF23F30FEDED/3F2D2805E5B983A925D77A725F39070E">source</a></p>

         	<p>Today is the second day of <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/12/21/trying-vivaldi.html">using Vivaldi on the Raspberry Pi 4 desktop</a>, and it continues to perform better for me than Chromium. I decided to run Octane 2 and Speedometer 2 to see how Vivaldi benchmarks against Chromium and I am surprised to find that it benchmarks slightly slower in both even though my practical use finds it faster. For example, Speedometer 2 scores 7.93 in Chromium and 7.614 in Vivaldi. For comparison, the Speedometer 2 score on the iPad Air is 201, fastest in the house.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the most dangerous ideas that emerged in politics starting in the 1970s is that changing one&rsquo;s mind about a policy or topic is wrong. We heard politicians claim that their opponent &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(politics)#Influence_on_public">flip-flops</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, too many people have taken this to mean that they must not change their minds about something, but changing one&rsquo;s mind over time is what growing up is all about. Is it any wonder then that people are now so entrenched in their ideas they simply do not listen nor accept anything spoken by someone else that they don&rsquo;t agree with?</p>

<p>The &ldquo;no flip-flop&rdquo; mindset can have dangerous consequences. If scientists aren&rsquo;t willing to consider the possibility that how they thought something happens, like <a href="https://nitter.net/zeynep/status/1341161935904059394#m">how respiratory illness spreads</a>, could be flawed, lives can be lost. Not to mention scientists who don&rsquo;t believe they could be wrong aren&rsquo;t really practicing science.</p>

<p>If you want to really impress me, tell me about something you changed your mind about in the last three years.</p>

         	<p>I use a Raspberry Pi 4 as a personal remote computer that I access using VNC during the work day, which enables me to keep my personal web access from going through my employer&rsquo;s Internet proxy. It&rsquo;s also an excuse of me to fiddle with the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>I have been using Chromium for browing the web but grown frustrated with its performance on the Pi so this morning I decided to give <a href="https://vivaldi.com">Vivaldi</a> a try. Vivaldi uses the same rendering engine as Chrome and I&rsquo;ve found it uses the same extensions as Chrome, which is important because I need access to Lastpass.</p>

<p>Installation was a little tricky because I am running <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1668160">a beta 64-bit version of the Raspberry Pi OS</a> and so I needed to find the <a href="https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/53927/linux-arm-32-64-bit-os-with-drm-enable-gpu-hardware-accelerated-how-to/2">arm64 version</a> of the installation package.</p>

<p>So far I am finding that Vivaldi does run faster on the Pi4 than Chromium. One thing I did to speed things up is to turn off the drop-down, URL completion of the address bar so that I can quickly enter URLs. However, one function that I use to forage for new updates in the Federated Wiki verse does not work, for some reason, so for now I will need to use Chromium for that part of my daily flow.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t dare say &lsquo;But the system worked&rsquo; when a majority of Republicans in Congress support the overturning of a free and fair election. You don&rsquo;t celebrate a cancer not having killed you yet. You celebrate when you&rsquo;re cancer free</p>

         	<p>“Several years ago when I was in Nicaragua, I asked a man if he had time, and he said, “I have the rest of my life,” and smiled. Who of us would possibly say that? That is what we don’t have. What we don’t have is the rest of our lives because we do not even have the now of our lives.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time is exactly what we do not have. What decreases in a culture of affluence is precisely and strangely time—along with wisdom and friendship. These are the very things that the human heart was created for, that the human heart feeds on and lives for. No wonder we are producing so many depressed, unhealthy and even violent people, while also leaving a huge carbon footprint on this poor planet.&rdquo;</p>

         	<p>I do not take comfort in SCOTUS deciding to not take up Texas&rsquo; lawsuit against the four swing states. First, SCOTUS simply hid behind procedure and thus were not the adults in the room standing against tyranny. What is even more troubling to me is that I am sure President Trump fully expected &ldquo;his&rdquo; SCOTUS justices to keep him in office, I am sure in his mind that is what they owed him for seating them. The fact that any person considers any judges to be &ldquo;his,&rdquo; particularly Justices is frightening.</p>

<p>What we must learn from this episode of U.S. history is that it matters how anyone who would be President views the powers and responsibilities of the office. The U.S. Constitution is not intended to give anyone extreme powers, its intention is exactly the opposite. The fact that people think elections are all about power shows how much we have strayed from the founding principles of the United States.</p>

<p>If we don&rsquo;t learn from this year and make meaningful changes then all we have done is prevent the end of the U.S. for the time being and increased the likelihood that it will not see its tricentennial. It takes more to preserve freedom than waving a flag and standing for the national anthem.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/opinion/trump-constitution-norms.html">Tim Wu makes a good case</a> that the vaunted &ldquo;checks and balances&rdquo; of the U.S. constitution has not really shown to be reality. The only thing that has prevented democracy in the U.S. from being overthrown has been the integrity of a frighteningly small number of people.</p>

<p>In my opinion we must not allow Republicans to paint a picture that this threat has only been because of Donald Trump. None of what we have endured is due to just Trump, in fact a case can be made that none of it is on Trump, instead it has all been on the Republican Party. Never forget, Trump won the Republican Party nomination for President, and if he had not then we would have not had four years of a Trump presidency and who knows how many fewer lives would have been saved from the pandemic.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t be patting ourselves on the back thinking democracy prevailed. All that we really have is possibly a victory of one battle, but Republicans have been waging war on the United States since the 1940s and will continue fighting that war in to the future. As long as there is no consequence on Republicans they will remain to be a clear and present danger.</p>

         	<p>I took a look at my Xfinity (Comcast) account again today due to the pending enforcement of their data caps. What I see on Xfinity&rsquo;s site is that while I thought they had turned caps off, it might have been on since July. What bothers me is that it doesn&rsquo;t look like Xfinity provides any warning to users when they are about to exceed their data cap. I thought there was an account configuration so that I could have Xfinity send me an email when I&rsquo;ve consumed 50% and 75% of the data, but I don&rsquo;t see any option. In my opinion, any service that has data caps and corresponding charges when they are exceed should be legally required to provide customers warnings that they are going to exceed those caps.</p>

What I like about Len is that he is a genuine baseball guy, he isn&rsquo;t a broadcaster who also does baseball, so moving from TV to radio makes sense. Of all sports baseball is best for radio.</p>

<p>My life experience with the Chicago Cubs has always been narrated by TV play-by-play guys: Jack Brickhouse, Harry Caray, Chip Caray, and Len Kasper. There have been a few others who have been briefly behind the mike, but these are the voices that replay in my head.</p>

<p>The first words are Jack&rsquo;s calling another Dave Kingman home run. Most of the words are spoken by Harry, who was with me from teenager to adult. Chip is sentimental following his grandfathers death, where Len will always be part of the Cubs finally making it to and winning the World Series in 2016.</p>

<p>White Sox fans are getting a great baseball guy to tell them the White Sox story when baseball starts in 2021. I might try to listen to a few games, particularly when the White Sox come to Detroit and Len sits closer to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Harwell">Ernie Harwell&rsquo;s</a> seat. In the meantime I&rsquo;ll watch for who will be next at broadcasting for the Cubs.</p>

<p>Even if allowed to, I will not eat in a restaurant until I am vaccinated and this pandemic is under control, for two main reasons. First, one cannot eat and wear a mask at the same time.

         	<p>I am completing the first week of using my <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/ipad-air">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/ipad-magic-keyboard">Magic Keyboard</a> during my work day and I am happy with the result. Over the years I&rsquo;ve tried using different keyboard cases with tablets and usually end up setting them aside because I found it too difficult to switch between hand-held and keyboard modes. The magnetic attachment of the iPad to the keyboard makes it easy to remove and re-attach the iPad to the case, so when I want to hold the tablet to read or write notes with the Apple Pencil, it&rsquo;s no more difficult than picking the iPad up off the table and when I want to type notes it&rsquo;s as easy as placing the iPad back on to the magnetic back of the case.</p>

<p>The main negative of the case is that it adds a lot of bulk and weight, so there are times when I won&rsquo;t want to carry both. When we get back to being able to travel around freely I will probably get Apple&rsquo;s Smart Folio, which also attaches magnetically, to protect the iPad Air in those instances.</p>

<p>I wish citizens of the United States would think a bit more deeply about our history, particularly the context in which First Amendment was written. The world from 313 AD until when the U.S. Constiution was ratified was basically governed by a theocracy. You had the Holy Roman Empire and Rome ruling most of the western world, then came Protestantism and it&rsquo;s alignment with kings and <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/thirty-years-war">The Thirty Years War</a>, and then, more directly you have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/cofe/cofe_1.shtml#:~:text=Henry%20VIII%20started%20the%20process,borne%20him%20only%20a%20daughter.&amp;text=Henry%20adopted%20the%20title%20given,of%20Defender%20of%20the%20Faith.">the Church of England</a> that emerged to consolidate power in England when Henry VIII wanted an annulment that the Pope would not grant.</p>

<p>The founders knew how those who seek power, be they kings, dictators, oligarchs, and political parties, use religion to increase that power. After all, it&rsquo;s one thing for a President to say something, it&rsquo;s another when a preacher claims what he or she says is the literal word of god.</p>

<p>So, while <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/">the first ammendment constrains</a> the U.S. government of what it can do to religions, <strong>more importantly it is intended to prevent the merger of religious and political power.</strong></p>

<p>I agree with Dana&rsquo;s warning about our real risk, which is the emergence of a religious-based rule in the United States. It started with Ronald Regan creating the snowball and rolling it down the hill to create the &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/Yz4AmUaLbUQ">Religious Right</a>&rdquo; under <a href="https://youtu.be/pPsderlzd6c">the pretext</a> of a Pro-Life movement. It picked up more steam to elect George W. Bush that lead to a tremendous amount of lost life in wars authorized by national emergencies that are still not over. And finally in a mutal in-sincere but profitable alliance, enabled and put in place Donald Trump, and with him the breaking of everything Jesus taught.</p>

<p>Please, if you call yourself Christian and find yourself agreeing completely with these claims of religions liberty, stop and consider the very real possibility that your actions are actualy enabling the very opposite of what you think will be the outcome. In the process you are handling over all your authority, necessary for people to even consider the Good News, let alone follow Jesus.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve responded <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/196">to this question</a> about &ldquo;what does one do with ideas&rdquo; with my wish for how products like Roam could be even better for me. In summary, I want an app like Roam that recognizes a string of text as the same as the title of an already existing page and automactically converts it to a link to that page without my having to specify it as such with square brackets.</p>

<p>I think the challenge is putting the &ldquo;new idea&rdquo; in a place that is connected/related in a way that easily re-surfaces. A common practice is to put all ideas in to one bucket/tickler file and then continually reviewing that bucket/tickler file, which itself requires discipline.</p>

<p>Roam has a nice feature that enables me to easily associate text to a future date so when that date arrives the app automatically displays that item. Roam isn&rsquo;t unique in this feature and associating to dates is probably an easy problem to solve, but what I would like would be an automated way associate an idea to a topic that can re-surface whenever I search for or write about the topic.</p>

<p>The closest example I can think of is glossary function in Fargo or wiki links in Roam but even those require remembering special functions, quotes for glossary, square brackets for wiki links. What I would love is to be able to tell software, whenever I write this string of text automatically convert the text to a hyperlink to this page of more information about it. For software to just do it for me it would have to constantly monitor my writing, like MS Word&rsquo;s spell/grammar check.</p>

<p>If memory serves, the closest experience I had to this was VoodooPad and WikiWikiWeb were you wrote in wikiwords like WhereIPutIdeas, that the software automatically converted to links, but that is flawed by the fact that one has to write in an unnatural way.</p>

<p>I guess what I want is some form of natural language processing of all text I write that queries against a collection of previously written pages and automatically links to matches. Even the backlinking in Roam requires some thinking/recollection on my part, unless there is something in Roam I have not yet discovered.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/11/28/i-think-that.html">On Saturday I wrote</a> that I think the real root cause behind why so many align themselves with Trump is the lack of good paying jobs that don&rsquo;t require a college degree. In his recent column for the New York Times, titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/26/opinion/republican-disinformation.html">The Rotting of the Republican Mind</a>, David Brooks pretty much writes the same thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under Trump, the Republican identity is defined not by a set of policy beliefs but by a paranoid mind-set&hellip;.You can’t argue people out of paranoia. If you try to point out factual errors, you only entrench false belief. The only solution is to reduce the distrust and anxiety that is the seedbed of this thinking. That can only be done first by contact, reducing the social chasm between the members of the epistemic regime and those who feel so alienated from it. And second, it can be done by policy, by making life more secure for those without a college degree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, while Brooks is putting the focus on Republican&rsquo;s, I think the same challenge lies with Democrats. The problem is that Trump and the Republican party really haven&rsquo;t done anything about the problem because they can&rsquo;t see the root cause, which I think is a combination of corporate greed by way of profit margins and a long history of anti-inflation that has conditioned us to seek out the lowest price for items we buy. (Have you ever enjoyed the thrill of finding a bargain?) I don&rsquo;t think either party is willing and able to do what is needed to address this issue.</p>

<p>As a thought exercise ask yourself, why is it that so many of the products you use every day are manufactured outside of the United States? (If you can find a label, take a look at it to see whether I am right or wrong.)</p>

<p>Many politicians of both parties will have you believe the problem is unfair trade practices by countries like China, which is the thinking behind Trump&rsquo;s tariffs that really did not result in more manufacturing jobs in the United States. Trade is a problem, but it&rsquo;s not the only problem.</p>

<p>Corporations do not manufacture in the United States because it costs more to manufacture items in the United States and what does that mean? Higher costs result in lower profit margins and if corporations want to maintain margins, which shareholders want them to do, then they have to increase the price of their products, but the problem with that is U.S. consumers do not like to pay higher prices. It appears something has to give, either corporations take lower profits or consumers pay higher prices. (And equally important because nearly everyone who can save for retirement does with either IRAs or 401ks is that a good number of the shareholders demanding margins that increase stock price are consumers of the products being manufactured.)</p>

<p>Can corporations and shareholders be convinced to live with lower profit margins for the sake of the country? Can consumers be convinced to pay more for items &ldquo;made in the U.S.A.&rdquo;? Can US manufacturing costs, a high portion of which is labor, be decreased?</p>

<p>You see here then the issue, there is no silver bullet, instead there is a need for a comprehensive solution that requires compromise by all parties. Democrats have to be willing to decrease regulations that increase manufacturing costs and Republicans have to be willing to work toward removing corporations&rsquo; burden of providing healthcare to its employees, which also increases the costs of labor. Serious discussion needs to occur within corporations and their boards of what is a fair profit margin and not just what they can drive the market toward (the starting point might be, what is a fair wage for CEOs?) and there needs to be a significant and continuous, buy made in the USA, marketing campaign to try to influence consumer purchasing.</p>

<p>The irony in all of this is that there was a time when both Republicans and Democrats campaigned on jobs, and jobs/the economy is still the issue now more than ever. The reason why Trump is popular is that his rhetoric and scapegoating resonates with the fear many Americans, particularly those without college degrees, feel. Scapegoating is an addictive drug, one feels good about &ldquo;sticking to it to the libretards,&rdquo; but when/if one looks around for change they will find no change to be found. Consequently, the only option that Republicans seem to have embraced is to keep the rhetoric going so that everyone stays happy enough to keep voting for the people placing the blame, which is themselves.</p>

         	<p>Too many of us are going to be affected directly or indirectly by COVID-19. I personally know four people that contracted the virus, had symptoms, and recovered although it took time. Unfortunately, the mother of a childhood friend died. I expect these numbers will increase, and I am not OK with that, but unfortunately not enough people share that same point of view. The United States of America is the only country in the world that puts perceived liberties over the reality of life and thinks it is better than every other country in the world.

         	<p>I am pondering the automatic keyboard lighting of the <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/ipad-magic-keyboard">Apple iPad Magic Keyboard</a>, which is based on ambient lighting and seems to be similar to the lighting adjustment on phones and tablets. Right now I am using the keyboard in a very well lit room and therefore I don’t need the keyboard on maximum brightness, but it is and that seems to align to phone screen brightness. You want phone screen brightness to increase outdoors so that you can read the screen, but it seems to me the backlighting of a physical keyboard should be the exact opposite, near zero in bright light, to save battery, and increase in brightness in darker rooms.</p>

         	<p>I think that despite <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/">the analysis of the election</a> around urban/rural and college educated/uneducated the common denominator is jobs. In the United States today it&rsquo;s nearly a given that in order for one to get a good paying job they must have a college degree. It also happens that those jobs are in urban areas. Further, while in the past there were plenty of good paying jobs in manufacturing that didn&rsquo;t require college degrees, we manufacture less in the U.S. than before so an increasing majority of jobs not requiring degrees are in services. Service industries don&rsquo;t pay high wages and are dependent on many external factors, which is why COVID has been so devastating to people in the U.S.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see one solution to the problem, the solution is a combination of decreasing the cost of getting a college degree, increasing existing service industry wages, and somehow increasing manufacturing in the United States. We must seek out and agree upon the incentives for doing each.</p>

         	<p>I ordered an open box / reduced price Apple Magic keyboard from Best Buy that I just received. Normally I don&rsquo;t order refurbished items, but I felt an accessory like a keyboard ought to be safe, and after combining the reduced price with some credit card reward points I got $100 reduced on the price.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to the unboxing, cut through the shrink wrap, open the box and all you find is the keyboard inside. I was surprised, given that this was a refurb, that the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; protected plastic wrap was on the keyboard.</p>

<p>There is literally no documentation in the box, I&rsquo;ve had to use Google to learn about some of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096">the standard keyboard shortcuts</a> given that there is no function key row.</p>

<p>I am sitting on a couch with the keyboard with iPad on my lap, typing as I would using any notebook computer. The keyboard is smaller, which is not a surprise given that this is the 11-inch model, but still, I can touch type just fine.</p>

<p>A few things to figure out. There is one function key, a key labeled with a globe at the lower left, that seems to be for selecting emojis, surely there is a way to change that? So far I haven&rsquo;t found one, although I have found some articles of useful information that I summarize below.</p>

It most recently started with an assault on facts, starting with the numbers of people who did not attend President Trump’s inauguration, continued through three years of assaulting the press, nearly one year of an assault on science and medicine, and now with the assault on the heart of democracy, the election.</p>

<p>The risk is not who will be seated as President on January 21, 2021. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-birther-myth-stuck-around-for-years-the-election-fraud-myth-might-too/">The damage has already been done</a>, going forward all elections will likely be questioned probably until someone comes up with the bright idea of just not having them.</p>

<p>All of this is on the hands of Republicans. To those who say Trump has the right to have his day “in court” I say, when did elections become about courts? There is a phrase, just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should do it. Do you not see the damage you are doing to our country? For now on tens of millions of people will no longer trust elections because you continue to sow the seed of doubt, and for what? So that you can retain power? Did Washington, Madison, Hamilton, and Jefferson fight for power? Did Lincoln give his life for power or did he do it to preserve the Republic? The party of Lincoln indeed.</p>

<p>Here is a fact. What is common between Nixon and Trump is that they are both Republican. One resigned before being impeached and then pardoned, the other was impeached and could still be pardoned. The two most undemocratic Presidents of my lifetime, Republicans.</p>

<p>And finally, to those Regan Republicans, most of whom are of my generation. The USSR had elections, in fact most socialist dictatorships have elections. In the USSR (and now Russia) the outcome of the election was assured before the first vote cast because the person in power could not lose. What makes democratic elections, such as the ones we claim to have in the United States, is that the person in power (the incumbent) can lose. It’s not just about a peaceful transition of power, it’s about accepting the will of the people.</p>

<p>Republican actions right now are saying loudly, they do not accept the will of the people, and in doing they delegitimize their claim as a party of a free and democratic United States of America.</p>

         	<p>It seems to me that another fundamental to our democracy is the fact  that a person can lose an election. Buried in Trump&rsquo;s claims of election fraud is the idea that he couldn&rsquo;t lose so because he did it must be illegit. It&rsquo;s like Putin going into his &ldquo;elections&rsquo; knowing he will win, except at least this time in the United States Trump does not have Putin&rsquo;s style measures in place to create no doubt about the outcome. In the Unitied States anyone running for office who thinks they cannot lose demonstrates their lack of knowledge or unwillingness to accept the very thing that makes America great! The very thing that makes Trump dangerous is that he sees himself as an autocrat, and such a person should never come close to holding the office.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It should be clear that Democrats need to work on their strategy for Presidential elections. If one is willing to listen to me, I have the following observations.</p>

<p>Simply getting out the vote will not work. It seems the conclusion drawn from 2016 is that Clinton lost because not enough Democrats voted. The thinking is based on the belief there are more Democrats than Republicans in the United States. The problem is, increating vote count only works in a pure democratic nationwide election, aka the popular vote, and we don&rsquo;t elect Presidents in the United States by popular vote. (The founders feared a pure democracy.)</p>

<p>Republicans have simplified the path to the White House: win rural votes by &gt; 50% margin and if you get 30% of the urban vote, you win, and that strategy aligns to the electoral college. In short, Democrats have to get more rural vote, which leads me to the one overriding fundamental that Democrats have to understand..</p>

<p><strong>Fear of socialism trumps everything else!</strong></p>

<p>People are not really voting on issues, which I think is why polling is not working. People are voting on fear and mostly fear of the other side. The Republican message is simple, Democrats are socialists, socialism = communism = evil = unAmercan, so vote Republican to save America!  A significant number of people are convinced they can never vote for a Democrat because that is a vote for Socialism. Add to that another significant number of people, call them evangelicals, who are convinced voting for a Demorat is a vote for killing babys and you have this result. And evangelials equate socialism to atheism which adds another reason why they fear Democrats. Then, sadly, add to the fact that there are too many who fear a vote for a Democrat is a vote for people of color over white people.</p>

<p>If you consider that Republican votes are mostly all about fear of what Democrats will do, I think you see how the Democrat primary and compaigns of 2016 and 2020 make the election strategy for Republicans easy because policies considered to be socialist AND politicians considered to be socialists (Bernie Sanders) dominated the campaigns.</p>

<p>In short, I think Bernie Sanders created a lot of fear among voters AND was a easy target. Even after Biden secured the nomination Republicans simply claimed Sanders would have significant influence over Biden because Democrats do want the Sanders followers support. I think this is true, hard to dispute and personally frustrating to me because Bernie is not even a Democrat!</p>

<p>Why does this matter? It matters because for extremism to be successful it needs an equally extreme opposite. The antidote to extremism is the middle and unfortunately that is shrinking rapidly. I think the only way the middle, call them moderates, can be recovered is via a third party but how we finance and run elections in the United States in the 21st century really makes it impossible for a viable third party.</p>

<p>In summary, fear of socialism trumps everything. It don&rsquo;t matter whether the Republican candidate is authoritarian, unqualified, and incapable of leading, it only matters that at Democrat doesn&rsquo;t get power and destroy the country.</p>

<p>I agree with CNN&rsquo;s high level use cases of each class of iPad in this article. For me, the iPad Mini is most used of the computing devices I own while the iPad Air will be used every work day and whenever I want to use a large screen device.</p>

         	<p>Today is the first day that I will be using the <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/ipad-air">iPad Air</a> full time in place of the 10.5-inch iPad Pro that it is replacing. Not sure whether I am liking the placement of the Touch ID sensor at the top on the power button. Having been using the iPad Pro 10.5 for three years and using the iPad Mini 5 muscle memory is trained to press my thumb at the bottom of the screen to turn on and unlock the device. I&rsquo;ve caught myself picking up the Air and putting my thumb were the home button used to be only to realize that does nothing but turn the screen on. No doubt I will re-learn a new behavior, but I can see how Face ID would be a better experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am certainly not an advocate for frequent and untried changes in laws and constitutions,” he wrote in an 1816 letter addressing what he perceived to be weaknesses in the new government, “but … laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.” &ndash;Thomas Jefferson</p>

         	<p>It seems to me that in order to have progress we need some agreement on what are the big problems. Many people think government itself, it&rsquo;s very existence, is the big problem, and they equate Democrats with pro government and pro big government. Others see that government as necessary, the problem is that it is not as effective as it should be. These others are Democrats and used to be a good number of Republicans too.</p>

         	<p>&ldquo;The founders were well aware of the dangers of populism, demagoguery, and faction. They built a constitutional order designed to force compromise and impede sociopathic behavior. But the institutions they put in place to act as gatekeepers (the Electoral College, the appointed Senate) became obsolete, and the successor gatekeepers (political bosses, smoke-filled rooms, big media) came to seem undemocratic and lost their grip. Today, the road to power for a sociopath or demagogue is comparatively unobstructed. As a result, the fail-safes designed to protect the system when the settings go out of alignment have themselves begun to fail.&rdquo; (nationalaffairs.com, <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/rethinking-polarization?smid=nytcore-ios-shar">Rethinking Polarization</a>)</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/10/16/covid-is-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-10-16 13:30:00 -0500">Oct 16, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>COVID-19 is <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/top-causes-death-united-states-heart-disease-cancer-and-covid-19/">the third highest cause of death</a> in the United States from February to October of 2020.  One of the problems we have is how people are viewing these deaths. Rather than viewing them as an &ldquo;event&rdquo; caused death, like 9/11, people are viewing as a disease caused death, like heart disease, cancer, and strokes. In this case they are thinking, hundreds of thousands of people die from disease every year and this is the same.</p>

<p>The reason why this matters is that some people who view these deaths as similar to other diseases are more willing to view the 200K+ deaths as acceptable, but what they are not taking in to account is that all of the other diseases on the list have known preventative measures, treatments, and expected impacts, whereas we have none of these for COVID-19. The number of deaths of the other diseases would be higher each year if not for the years and years worth of science to lower the risk.</p>

<p>Further, neither heart disease or cancer, which are the two higher causes of death so far this year, are something in which a health person contracts the disease and can die in a matter of days or even weeks.</p>

<p>The point is that we should all be angry about the number of people who have died from COVID-19, particularly if we claim to place a high value on life. Surely, like all other places around the world, some people would have died no matter what, but nobody should view 200K+ deaths as acceptable and the problem is there is not true end in sight because there is zero leadership in the United States toward anything that resembles a plan.</p>

<p>The closest to what appears to be the plan is to just let the disease run its course. Perhaps another 100+ or more people will die, and too many people are ok with that so long as they can go wherever and do whatever they want to do. Meanwhile other nations in the world took active measures and controlled the very same disease we seem unwilling to fight, and did so for the sake of everyone in their country!</p>

<p>For people who want to put country over seemingly anything else, I don&rsquo;t know how they can be proud of how we, the United States, is handling this crisis.</p>

The pandemic raises the question though of whether the right to liberty, which appears to be translated by most as meaning the right to do anything they want, stands above the right to life.</p>

<p>Ironic isn&rsquo;t it, that as we begin to witness another series of SCOTUS confirmation hearings, we are witnessing this very debate in which Republicans insist that the right to life is paramount over the liberty of a woman to choose what to do with her body. No matter then the hypocrisy of these same Republicans insisting their right to liberty is paramount over everyone else&rsquo;s right to life. Well, if you <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-sen-mike-lee-says-rank-democracy-bad-for-america-2020-10">seek the common denominator</a> you might find there really isn&rsquo;t any hypocricy.</p>

         	<p>It seems logical to me that the number of cases of COVID-19 will increase as the weather gets colder in the northern United States causing people to spend more time indoors without good ventilation. <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2020/10/11/michigan-again-at-high-risk-for-virus-outbreak-amid-worry-of-2nd-wave-data-shows/">A report</a> over the weekend appears to provide the statistical evidence, the R0, or rate of infection, has jumped to 1.12, you want it to be below 1. Daily new cases per 100,000 people is 11.7, a number above 10 is considered high. The good news is that ICU occupancy is low so for now hospitals appear to be capable of meeting demand, but an increase in the rate of spread increases the probability of people with pre-existing conditions who catch the virus need hospitalization. Lending further support to the &ldquo;colder weather&rdquo; theory is the fact that the new Michigan outbreak is in the Upper Peninsula.</p>

<p>Given the Michigan Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision that the Governor has over-stepped her authority with her efforts to contain the disease and the Republican party&rsquo;s preference to not issue mandates, it is likely the spread will increase unless citizens self comply or take county and city health orders seriously. I expect the State Legislature to pass legislation to prevent counties and cities from issuing their own health orders.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have a great deal of respect for the people who layed the foundation of the computer technology I use today, people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>, <a href="http://www.bricklin.com/">Dan Bricklin</a>, <a href="http://about.fed.wiki/view/ward-cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>, and <a href="http://scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a>. I follow Ward and Dave the closest because they actively write and because I use their work every day.</p>

<p>I am struck by the similarities and differences  between Ward and Dave&rsquo;s work. Ward created wiki, which is a tool he created to write and share pattern languages. Wiki&rsquo;s emphasis is on easy writing and hyperlinking, which I think was the intended purpose of the Web. Dave also created writing tools, the outliner and blogs, that simplify publishing of writing on the Internet and he also created RSS to make it easier for one to keep up with the writing on the Internet. Dave&rsquo;s original work is the conceptual basis for <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my stream</a> while Ward&rsquo;s original work provides the tools for <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">my garden</a>.</p>

<p>I like <a href="http://this.how/littleoutliner/">outlines</a> and find that I really like <a href="https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki">Federated Wiki</a> and today I realized that the similarity between them is that both provide context to writing but in different ways. Outlines are hiearchical while Federated Wiki has a lineup that shows context between source and destination links in a horizontal and linear fashion. I think this ability to easily see context and connections is also why I like <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> and use it for my private notes.</p>

<p>I am not sure that this matters much to others, but I think there is a relationship between context and history. History is the context of our lives and I think a great deal of our problems come from a failure to see meaning or to see what is really happening because we fail to know the context. Part of the problem may be that it&rsquo;s too difficult to find the context of history, that&rsquo;s where tools like oultliners might help, and because it is so difficult few people really take the time to seek out and understand context.</p>

<p>Context is needed for true understanding, knowledge, and thus wisdom and today there is a huge deficiency of wisdom.</p>

I find my reaction is less about whether or not I agree with Om as much as the fact that he appears to associate Amercia&rsquo;s not decline with wealth. Fixation on wealth as a measure of success is a uniquely human problem that is becoming more problematic, particularly for the United States. Should freedom and liberty be defined in wealth terms?</p>

<p>As to the site&hellip; why couldn&rsquo;t the dialog occur between two people writing on their own blogs?</p>

Historically, digital pens only work with the tablets made by the manufacturer of the pen, and the pens are not portable between tablets. USI is a protocol intended to enable one to use a pen across multiple tablets. Thus, the Lenovo stylus I just got is supposed to not only work with the Lenovo Duet, but other tablets and notebook computers that support USI.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have another device that supports USI, but I can say that the stylus I received just worked with the Duet once I got the pen powered up, there was no pairing process. The problem that I have with this stylus is that its tip is too big and round and so writing with it is like writing with a used medium tip marker rather than like a fine point pen. The tip on the Apple Pencil and Microsoft Surface Pen is much more like a pencil or pen so that what you write on the screen does not look like big fat characters.</p>

<p>The upside to the Lenovo USI is that it only cost me $31, which is considerabily cheaper than the Apple Pencil. However, even if it is cheap, the fact that one cannot really write digital ink that approximates a fine tip pen will hinder its usefullness.</p>

         	<p>I am thinking that the state of COVID-19 in the United States may be less of a failure of leadership than we want to think. Imagine if this happened while Obama were President. Yes, the response would be more efficient, like hospital supplies would be better managed, but I think the people refusing to do the right things now, like wearing masks and social distancing, would refuse to do them with Obama as President.The same Republican Governors and state legislatures would do the same thing they are doing now.</p>

<p>In many ways the U.S. response to COVID-19 is the same as how respond to mass shootings, no matter where they occur. We are trapped in a selfish, individualistic mindset fueled by capitalists and religious and taken advantage of by the power brokers.</p>

Trump <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/z_pyAge2r_k/index.html">and those directly in his orbit</a> do not care about others, and apparently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/notre-dame-white-house-coronavirus/2020/10/02/7b1a38a0-051d-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html">people who should know better</a>, like college professors and presidents, as if in an abusive relationship, are too intimidated to stand for themselves.</p>

<p>The purpose of wearing a mask is so that one may not spread the virus to others. Because Trump has demonstrated he does not care at all for others, anyone coming in close physical contact with him is putting their life in danger. This act alone is a violation of Trumps oath of office, but since grown ups who identify Republican were incapable of standing up to him and removing him from office when they had the chance, they get to suffer the consequences. (Republicans, when will you face the fact that Trump is not one of you and doesn&rsquo;t care about you?)</p>

<p>Isolate Trump in the White House until after the election.  No more tax dollars spent on him to spread the virus around. <a href="http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/0MQ3Hs42rKk/index.html">No more press conferences</a>. No rallies. Enough is enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strategically speaking, it weakens any credibility that the US has, in terms of being a competent global leader prepared to confront threats. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Making America Great? Greatness is not self declared, it is determined by consensus of others. If I say I am great, I am being arrogant. America&rsquo;s greatness is thus truly determined by the people who live in countries other than the United States of America.</p>

<p>We were first considered great in 1787 when we did something never done before by creating a nation governed by citizens rather than ruled by monarchs. Any doubt was removed by the end of World War II when we saved the world from fascism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we got drunk on our own press clippings, puffed our chest, and started trying to impose our superiority upon the world, first in Korea, then in Vietnam, and as we started losing the &ldquo;war&rdquo; in Vietnam the government declared war on its own citizens, which has been raging toward the near boiling point that we are experiencing now.</p>

<p>It turns out to be great you do have to care about others. Nobody ever thought to be great was so self centered as to not be willing to sacrifice for the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main overarching issue, which has been the issue since the 2016 election, is Trump says X, and Democrats and progressives say, “Can you believe he just said X?” That’s the problem</p>

<p>Compare this to the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, which gained a positive reaction from Republicans simply because he was &ldquo;angry.&rdquo; Trump&rsquo;s strategy is to appear stronger than Biden, but the thing is his definition of strength is not the same as many other&rsquo;s definition.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I do too, and there is nothing wrong with that, record keeping is important. In my work I take notes to record what I did and I often have do search for things along the lines of &ldquo;when this last broke, what did we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if you are Republican, honestly ask yourself if your answer would be different if Gore were a Republican.</p>

<p>As we head in to this Presidential election your answer to this question might be the most consequential one of your lifetime. A test of patriotism happens only when you put something bigger like your country above your own self interests like your tribe.</p>

         	<p>I am not surprised that Republican Senators who otherwise seem to oppose Trump, like Romney, are all in on getting their Supreme Court Justice approved. The whole reason why they have been tolerating Trump is to get those Justices and there is no way they are not going to claim that prize. Further, I think they see it it likely Trump will lose and it is possible they could lose the Senate, so that have to do it now or never. Republicans are long past the point where fairness matters, and their constituency is only their tribe and not Americans in general. From their point of view, given Supremes are for life, SCOTUS is their last chance to secure <strong>their way of life</strong> for the next decade.</p>

So, there must be planned iterations that improve performance and get the price down to a point where it is more affordable to more people. The other thing to watch is, whether the Surface Neo sees the light of day. You might recall it as the larger &ldquo;booklet&rdquo; Surface that Panay showed last year, but it would run Windows 10x. My understanding is that the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview&amp;cid=msft_web_collection">Surface Pro X</a>, which is the ARM Surface, is not exactly flying out of stores.

A reason might be that not once did he refer to the price and thus didn&rsquo;t get in to the &ldquo;for this price one should not have these problems&rdquo; trope. IMHO any gadget priced north of $1K is too expensive even if it works perfectly!</p>

<p>So, if price is an issue, save the time and the pixels and just write, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too expensive&rdquo; and move on. Because Kevin is not on a mission to drive home the point that the device is too expensive, he focuses more on the actual problems and frankly, what he writes about seem to be something that Microsoft could address in software updates.</p>

<p>The most important point that Kevin makes, though, is about the biases toward what the Duo is, even though Microsoft has emphasized it is not a phone or a tablet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think people are calling the Duo a phone because that&rsquo;s the closest device comparison they can make. And I get that. But the Duo truly is something different and, along with other folding or swivel screen devices, early in the trend of a new device class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I like this thought&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And although Microsoft dubbed it the Duo over a year ago, I think the company should have said that &ldquo;Duo&rdquo; is just an internal product code name. A better, more descriptive name would have been Surface Booklet because that&rsquo;s really what it is: A connected book-like tablet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be fair, <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/09/11/it-is-easy.html">I noted before</a> that Brad Sams also took effort to emphasize the Duo being a class on its own, although he used device classification of Personal Digital Assistant (PDA).</p>

It&rsquo;s why so much is written in the Old Testament about idolatry.

<p><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/first-amendment">The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution</a> may be one of the most enlightened of the writings that were a result of The Enlightenment because James Madison and the Founders understood how Power uses religion to enslave and thus increase power.

</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://petri.com/surface-duo-review-the-pursuit-of-productivity">Brad Sams&rsquo; review of the Microsoft Duo</a> is the first I&rsquo;ve seen that calls it a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), which I suspect is a better categorization than smartphone or tablet. The problem again comes back to price, it&rsquo;s just way too expensive and doesn&rsquo;t not provide enough for that expensive beyond being a niche product.  My hope is that Microsoft and Google don&rsquo;t give up on it too soon and find a way to get the price down.</p>

Compare reviews of the Google Pixel 4a and the Microsoft Duo, in some ways they are the same, but because the 4a only costs $350 the issues are understandable or overlooked. Devices priced at $1k or higher need to be perfect; the Duo appears to be a beta, akin to Google Glass.</p>

While I think Woodward withheld what he learned earlier in the year for the sake of book sales, I am not convinced that reporting what he had or even playing the tapes would have made any difference. Republican Senators had plenty of evidence to find Trump guilty and ignored that for sake of party, THEY are the ones most at fault for the loss of lives and we ought not forget it. At this point the only remedy is to vote Trump out of office.</p>

         	<p>&ldquo;Just remember this: no one can keep you from the second half of your own life except yourself. Nothing can inhibit your second journey except your own lack of courage, patience, and imagination. Your second journey is all yours to walk or to avoid. My conviction is that some falling apart of the first journey is necessary for this to happen, so do not waste a moment of time lamenting poor parenting, lost job, failed relationship, physical handicap, gender identity, economic poverty, or even the tragedy of any kind of abuse. Pain is part of the deal. If you don&rsquo;t walk into the second half of your own life, it is you who do not want it. God will always give you exactly what you truly want and desire. So make sure you desire, desire deeply, desire yourself, desire God, desire everything good, true, and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/08/19/computing-is-art.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-08-19 09:20:24 -0500">Aug 19, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve read two articles this week that make the case for treating Computer Science as something other than Computer Science. The one, titled, <a href="https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/8/246368-why-computing-belongs-within-the-social-sciences/fulltext">Why Computing Belongs With The Social Sciences</a>, argues that we will not gain more ethical computing from college curricula that have &ldquo;Computing Ethics&rdquo; classes but only by moving Computing in to the Social Sciences. The author points to the increasing relationship between algorithms and power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recommendation algorithms, automated sanctioning systems, reactive violation detection and prediction systems, and nudge architectures are replacing the human agency built into our legal and political systems with an architecture of unknowable black boxes allowing the one-way surveil and control of people without any corresponding contestation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an essay titled <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters</a>, Paul Graham notes that while he graduated with a Computer Science degree, he self identifies as a hacker, which is the likely image most people have of one who holds a CompSci degree. Graham says that hackers are like painters and writers because they make things. The following is for me the most important quote in the essay.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one. Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are practically solipsists. It&rsquo;s hard for such people to design great software [5], because they can&rsquo;t see things from the user&rsquo;s point of view</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both articles resonate strongly with me. I graduated in 1989 with a Computer Science degree and have been working in the Information Technology industry for more than thirty years and I can say that I have never used any of the specifics of my computer science classes save for one, one Software Engineering. I also got a minor in secondary education and what gained from that part of my college learning I applied frequently throughout my career.</p>

<p>In my experience computing is more art than a science and more about humans than machines and yet neither of these realities were part of my formal computer science education. Granted, much time has passed since I graced the college classrooms so I know curricula has changed, but yet given the &ldquo;market&rdquo; pressures on colleges I suspect the most focus on producing employable graduates, with life long skills a secondary benefit rather than primary focus.</p>

         	<p>Last year, about Chicago Cubs, <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/08/17/go-cubs-go.html">I wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem is not the hitting, although they could be more consistent. To me the problem is the bullpen, they are giving up too many runs in the 6 thru 9th innings. Nobody in the pen is reliable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could not imagine that at the same time a year later the Cubs would be playing under such strange circumstances like they will today, playing two seven inning games in a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; double-header. Yet, while the Cubs have the best record, the bullpen performance has not been much different.</p>

         	<p>The Chicago Cubs have now lost three games in a row. Normally that would not be a problem, but in a short season, it feels like they really need to win at least one game today against the Cardinals. Preferably win both.</p>

         	<p>It seems to me that comparing something that is intended to create a new category of device against current categories is flawed. My read of <a href="https://4thquadrant.io/freearticles/business-models/microsofts-surface-duo-not-a-product-review/">this take on the Microsoft Surface Duo</a> is that it is designed for productivity, smartphones are not designed for productivity, but we will compare it to smartphones anyway.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the real problem with the Surface Duo is its price. Anything that requires one to spend &gt;$1,000 demands more discretion. Right now the price is a barrier to entry that is going to prevent Microsoft from selling many units.</p>

         	<p>In a blog post today Om Malik asks, <a href="https://om.co/2020/08/13/gig-economy-work/">What is work?</a> and I think he touches on a root cause of Trumpism. Basically, many people have a hard time seeing a future in which they have a good paying job and nobody seems to have an answer. Democrats are supposed to support labor via union representation, but instead appears to be in bed with corporations and the wealthy as much as Republicans. The traditional Republican Party has no better answers, leaving a vacuum that allows for the scapegoating that Trump promotes.</p>

<p>Except, scapegoating is itself a misdirection no different than anyone else because it puts focus on China and not on the corporations that use Chinese labor. Pick up anything and you will likely find a &ldquo;made in China&rdquo; sticker, but is that the fault of China or the &ldquo;American&rdquo; company who sell the product? And what if American&rsquo;s hunt for the bargain that pushes change companies toward low cost labor so they can maintain profit margins?</p>

         	<p>Perhaps the most important skill we learn in life is how we make decisions. Too little time is spent reflecting on this skill in ourselves, and evaluating it in leaders. How we see the world influences the decisions we make. If everything that happens is viewed through the lense of how it affects me personally, for example, does this help or hurt my chances for re-election, then most of the decisions I make are for my own self interest. (Note that very, very few people do NOT make any decisions in their self interest. I am talking about degree)</p>

<p>I suggest that over the course of history, those who history says are good leaders put common interest above their own in the moments that matter. For me the decision making process is a core competency of anyone who I consider to recognize as leader and who may gain my vote in an election.</p>

<p>Incumbents have the blessing or curse of having demonstrated how they make decisions, and thus tend to have an easier or sometimes bigger hurdle to overcome.</p>

A few years ago I had uploaded all the music I had ripped from CDs to Play Music as a form of online backup, and I always appreciated the fact that I could access that music using the Play Music app on my Android devices, and I can cast my music to any of my Chromecasts and Google Home devices. Much to my surprise and disappointment, I have found that YT Music only lets me cast music to one of my Chromecast devices and tells me if I want to cast to others, like Google Home, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/54547361?hl=en">I need to upgrade to premium</a>.

         	<p>I am one of the many people who used and really liked the DarkSky weather app on Android. While the Android app is great, the main reason why I bought the premium subscription was for the Wear OS app. Now that Apple bought DarkSky and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/android-version-of-popular-dark-sky-weather-app-shuts-down/">shutdown the Android app</a>, I&rsquo;ve lost the DarkSky app and complications on my watch.</p>

<p>I switched to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accuweather.android&amp;hl=en_US">the AccuWeather app</a> on my smartphone, but while it does have a Wear OS component, it is really bad in comparison to DarkSky and doesn&rsquo;t have complications. I am hoping AccuWeather beefs up the Wear OS app over time. The whole DarkSky aquisition by Apple was really disappointing.</p>

         	<p>Today is a primary election day here in Michigan and we voted from home for the first time. Some notes regarding voting from home now that I experienced it first hand. First, while it is most often referred to as &ldquo;vote by mail&rdquo; one can actually hand deliver their ballots at the township clerk&rsquo;s office. In my case the township have several outside, 24x7 lock boxes and an internal (available during business hours) lock box. The point being, one is not constrained to using the USPS for delivery of their ballot. Second is that if I am honest, we probably would not have voted in this election because it is a primary, so &ldquo;voting from home&rdquo; caused me to participate in government as intended.</p>

The <a href="https://getpocket.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidauthority.com%2Fgoogle-pixel-4a-review-1140618%2F">just announced Pixel 4a</a> has a larger 5.81-inch screen but the physical dimensions are 144 x 69.4 x 8.2mm and it also weighs 143 grams. In other words, the 4a is actually smaller than my Pixel 2 but a little thicker to accommodate a larger battery but weighs the same. I am really happy about those physical specs and looking forward to getting mine!</p>

         	<p>The damage of <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/07/30/politics/federalist-society-trump-election-mail-in-voting/index.html">Trump&rsquo;s election tweet</a> has already been done. The con is all about sowing doubt, and the fact that a POTUS is even willing to suggest it says all that one needs to know. Trump never has understood nor appreciated the Constitution nor the Republic for which it stands, and that was known at the time when he was impeached by the House. In fact, it&rsquo;s basically why he WAS IMPEACHED! Republicans have been aiding the con since he took office and had a chance to do the right thing in the impeachment trial. You might try to save face, but any claims you make now you bring also on yourself. Any statements to the contrary to anyone who call themselves a Federalist is laughable.</p>

<p>The second reaction is that there are two big issues at play here. One is &ldquo;anti-elitism,&rdquo; which is a point of view of which there are no experts to trust, everyone should just &ldquo;go with their gut&rdquo; or &ldquo;use common sense.&rdquo; In most Republican circles &ldquo;elites&rdquo; are Democrats or liberals to be ignored out right.</p>

<p>The second issue is relationship between federal and local governments. It&rsquo;s clear that the Republicans in charge right now think there is no legitimate role for the federal government beyond defense. In their eyes the federal government has no responsibility for solving &ldquo;big problems&rdquo; of the nation. In some ways their view of government is more Articles of Confederation than U.S. Constitution. (I find it ironic that a Conservative group calls themselves The Federalist Society but acts more anti-federalist.)</p>

<p>Stated differently, current Republicans take Reagan&rsquo;s phrase &ldquo;The Federal government is not the solution, the federal government is the problem&rdquo; very literally, and apparently lost on them is the irony that the words were spoken by a man seeking the position of being the top person of that federal government.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve recently purchased a Lenovo Duet, which is a Chrome OS 2-in-1. I am a long time Chromebook user and own a Pixelbook, but the Duet is the first Chrome OS tablet I&rsquo;ve used and the first time that I&rsquo;ve installing other Android browsers like Brave. Chrome OS really doesn&rsquo;t like that there is more than one browser on the Duet because every time I click a hyperlink I get a prompt asking me which browser I want to open it in. There should be a way to override this so I can tell Chrome OS only open hyperlinks in Chrome and don&rsquo;t bother asking me, but I haven&rsquo;t found one it exists.</p>

         	<p>The irony of our time is that the phrase on those hats, &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; were prophetic four years ago. The problem is that Americans don&rsquo;t seem to understand that greatness is not self-declared. Greatness can be aspirational but for it to be so requires an understanding of how others define greatness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the eve of America’s anniversary—our two hundred and forty-fourth—much of the world believes that the country is racist, battered and bruised. “Europe has long been suspicious—even jealous—of the way America has been able to pursue national wealth and power despite its deep social inequities,” Robin Niblett, the director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, also known as Chatham House, in London, told me.</p>

         	<p>I’ve made two purchases from Best Buy online since COVID-19, which is a bit unusual because I normally order from Amazon. What I am even more surprised by is that I prefer Best Buy’s shipping because they use UPS. I find Amazon’s in-house delivery random and unpredictable where as UPS deliveries are part of a regular route by the same guy at nearly the same time. Further, they provide GPS tracking of the delivery truck so I can see where my package is in route to my house on the day of delivery, which enables me to be ready to receive the package so it isn’t waiting outdoors. I also get text messages of the delivery status. Amazon provides notices but no real tracking. Further, since Amazon delivery is random, packages can end up in all sorts of strange places. Amazon saves money, but I find their customer service has taken a hit in the process.</p>

         	<p>It seems like outlining and <a href="http://outlinerhowto.opml.org/">outliners</a> is a recurring theme. <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/06/30/june302017.html">Three years ago I wrote</a> about how I much I like outliners and thus keep looking for &ldquo;perfect app.&rdquo; Right now I am using Little Outliner, Dynalist, and Roam. Each have their imperfections.  I read through the Gruber&rsquo;s twitter thread that <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/29.html#a140838">Dave linked to</a> yesterday and it is a surprise how few people understand what is a true outliner app.</p>

We will see ongoing hot spots where people congregate in places  like bars. The question is whether we can sustain these levels for the next 2 to 3 years as that is how long it will take to get a vaccine and get enough people to take the vaccine.</p>

         	<p>In a way, Apple&rsquo;s move of Mac OS to ARM puts it  back into competition with Microsoft. Microsoft has been working to run Windows on ARM for a while, now Apple will start showing them how it is done, particularly in how it provides support for legacy applications, but also in how to seemlessly host mobile and desktop applications on the same platform. In this later case, Apple&rsquo;s OS strategy is moving closer to what Google has been doing with Chrome OS.</p>

<p>Today, I was thinking about our future post-pandemic reality. A contactless future is going to become obvious. With the retail and restaurant sectors struggling and shrinking, we will start seeing the places which make us part of a society, a neighborhood, humans begin to go away. A dry cleaner here, a coffee shop there. What will remain of society?</p>

It is part of what we call &ldquo;common sense.&rdquo; And it is the way most of the college students that NSF and I talked to had &ldquo;learned science&rdquo;&ndash;as isolated cases, stories that would be retrieved to deal with a similar situation, not as a system of inter related arguments about what we think we know and how well we think we know it.</p>

         	<p>Unions have a place in protecting labor and there really is no institution that protects and advocates in behalf of labor than unions. Historically Democrats have been supported by unions because they tend to support pro-labor policies, but they aren&rsquo;t dedicated solely to labor. Democrats pushed NAFTA, which wasn&rsquo;t a good thing for labor in the U.S.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like everything in life, unions can be abusive. Like the idea taking a look at the scope of work for police departments, and perhaps thinking of ways to handle them differently, the same should be done with unions. We have to keep the good things that unions do and <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/09.html#a174718">not simply disband them</a>, in fact, I think we need stronger advocacy for ALL labor that includes both traditional blue collar and white collar jobs.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/what-ive-seen/">A first person story</a> by a person in Minneapolis, worth the read. It made me think that one of many problems we have is that we want believe we live in a simple, dualistic world, but that is not reality. It takes awareness of oneself and the willingness to spend the time to grow to embrace the both/and-ness of reality.</p>

         	<p>Dave Winer makes <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/06/01/142621.html?title=morningCoffeeTweets#a150749">a very good point</a> about how Trump has handled COVID-19. A competent politician should easily gain re-election in a time of national crisis simply by being a unifying force. The fact that he hasn&rsquo;t done so is a clear example of his incompetence that Republicans should really be concerned about. As much as we claim we don&rsquo;t like politicians and think anybody can be President, the basic skills needed for the job in a Democracy is political. You wouldn&rsquo;t hire a mechanic to fix your car who doesn&rsquo;t have the experience nor the skills to actually repair the car. Trump is not competent for the position of President of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The police and the U.S. military are separate institutions because policing a community and fighting a war are supposed to be separate jobs. In traditional “wars,” both sides are heavily armed. In Minnesota, only the agents of the state appear to be wearing body armor and carrying long guns. And yet: State officials are calling this “warfare” on official public channels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it began with the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/crime/the-war-on-drugs">War On Drugs</a>&rdquo; in the 70s and 80s that turned the United States into an incarceration state.</p>

         	<p>Is communication on a corporately owned platform communication on a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/trump-social-media-executive-order/">public square</a>? I don&rsquo;t think so. The first amendment <em>constrains governments</em> from impeding free speech. In other words, it protects citizens from government, not the other way around. Citizens United endowed corporations with rights of citizenship, so then Isn&rsquo;t Trumps executive order really an impediment on Twitter&rsquo;s free speech rights?</p>

         	<p>I think the COVID-19 response exposes a problem with the current state of lack of trust created through an increase in extreme points of view, both left and right. Consequently, people now seem to only trust what they can see with their own eyes or what make sense to them. Therefore, people are less likely to take COVID-19 seriously until they are personally affected in some way.</p>

<p>For such people, <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144355">a young person&rsquo;s account of surviving COVID-19</a> published by the New York Times is not believed because they don&rsquo;t trust the New York Times. Likewise anything <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144838">published by the NewYorker</a>. <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/05/18/145203.html?title=examplesOfSavemylifeJournalism#a144627">A blogger&rsquo;s first hand account</a> is meaningless because I don&rsquo;t know the blogger.</p>

<p>In short, the problem cannot be placed on external entities that are not trusted. The problem isn&rsquo;t with journalism not doing something so much as journalism having no credibility from an extremist point of view unless that journalist is identified as having the same extremist point of view.</p>

<p>Howard Stern echos something I&rsquo;ve said for a while, but I think what may be the case is that these people don&rsquo;t necessarily love Trump himself so much as what he represents to them, which they personally identify with. They see themselves in Trump&rsquo;s persona and thus any negative statement about him is translated as a personal attack in them. To these people we are deep within a class war between &ldquo;elites&rdquo; and what they believe are &ldquo;normal people,&rdquo; which they define as anyone who agrees with and acts like them, and which they call &ldquo;common sense.&rdquo; The war began when Newt Gingrich ascended to Speaker of the House.</p>

         	<p>I am one of many people who really like the note-taking app called <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam</a> that is currently in beta. However, it seems some think that bidirectional note linking is the primary feature of Roam, and while I think bidirectional note linking is a differentiator it is not the only reason why I prefer Roam.  For me the main reason why I like Roam is that it is an outliner for developing and maintaining a wiki that automatically supports bidirectional links.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried <a href="https://www.amplenote.com/blog/bidirectional_note_linking_and_an_offer_for_roam_exporters">amplenote.com</a> that claims to be an alternate to Roam that supports bidirectional links, and I does in fact do a very good job of importing content from Roam. However, Amplenote is not an outliner and I quickly found that true outlining, not just bullet lists, is a must have requirement for me.</p>

It requires people to wear masks in public, to get tested, to stay home if they get sick and it will require people to be willing to get vaccinated when a vaccine becomes available.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we live in a world where selfishness and greed is the default expectation. In that world in which you cannot count on people to do the right thing, someone has to be a parent and that means the government.</p>

         	<p>It is a strange time to celebrate a birthday, and yet, here I am celebrating in midst of a COVID-19 imposed lock down. Actually, this is not a new experience for me. Once before I celebrated a birthday while confined to the walls of my home and compared to that experience this one is much better. I find how people are reacting to a reality in which they do not have control to be very instructive. A self-centered view of the world is a creation of the ego projected inward and outward by the Powers That Be.</p>

The facts just don&rsquo;t support that thinking. <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/documents/MIFluFocus_1_5_06_146893_7.pdf">The government tracks the flu</a> and the from what I see the peak influenza-associated hospitalizations in the entire state was about 150 in 2017-18. over a 30 week period of time. Right now we have that many people in individual hospitals, so probably 10x that number across the entire state.</p>

<p>Little Outliner creates and edits outlines written in OPML, which is an XML-based file format for outlines that Dave created. If you only need to view and edit files, Little Outliner is all you need. Dave recently released <a href="http://my.this.how/davewiner/howtos.opml">a web service that renders an OPML file as a web page</a>, the net result is a simple way to create a nice looking web page. I&rsquo;ve decided to use this to create <a href="http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml">my /now page</a>, all I have to do is edit the file in Little Outliner. You will find the link to this page in the footer the pages on this site.</p>

<p>You may notice that the subheads in the page have a littlle upside down triangle, those are parent nodes of the source outline, the following indented text are children nodes. If you click the triangle the node will collapse, click it again and it expands. By default all of the nodes render as expanded but you can configure a node to collapse by default. Click node you want to configure as collapsed, then click the suitecase icon on the left toolbar, click the plus button on the Edit attributes window;  in the left field enter collapse, in the right field enter true, and then click Save. Refresh the web page and you see node/head you configured will be collapsed.</p>

         	<p>Trump seems to think the most important measure of his success is the stock market. The reality is that the stock market is driven significantly by emotions, either confidence (bull) or fear (bear). The only tool a President really has in relation to the stock market is his or her ability to lead. People know leadership when they see it, and they look for leadership for confidence and void of seeing such leadership have fear. Consequently, the stock market is telling us much of what we need to know about President Trump and that is he is not a leader, but this was obvious in 2016 to anyone willing to see beyond the theater perpetrated by Trump and everyone around him. After we get through this crisis I wonder whether we will truly place blame where it belongs, which is how a person of Trump&rsquo;s deep character flaws and probable mention disorder was elected. We need to truly look at how we elect Presidents and make changes&hellip;. that or Congress has to get a whole less political and much more representative of ALL Americas and execute it&rsquo;s oversight obligations given it by the Constitution. (The Senate had it&rsquo;s chance of saving tens of thousands of lives when it had the chance to remove Trump from office.)</p>

         	<p>Trump has been running for re-election from the first day after he was elected President. A politician constantly running for re-election cannot lead, and we need leadership. The leader we need now has only one objective, to save as many lives in the near term and long term as possible. I don&rsquo;t know if such a leader exists, worse I am not sure the American people have the will to allow such a leader to exist.</p>

         	<p>“The relationship between America and China was not “normal” before COVID-19. It was in rapid decline. And that decline has left Americans more vulnerable to the disease. The lesson of this plague isn’t that America should stop cooperating with China. It’s that America must rebuild the public-health cooperation that the Trump administration helped destroy.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-china-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/">Trump’s Break With China Has Deadly Consequences</a></p>

<p>In November Americans will hopefully have the opportunity to decide whether to replace Trump as president and for that we not only need to assess how he and his administration handled this crisis, but also the ways in which he was responsible for it.</p>

<p>The isolationism he has been putting in place has contributed immensely to how bad COVID19 has been for the United States. As far as disease is concerned, imports and tariffs have nothing to do with it, rather it&rsquo;s about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html">the tremendous amount of global travel</a> that occurs every single day. Even if you restricted travel to China you can&rsquo;t stop the possibility of an American being in a conference room in Germany with a person who traveled there from China.</p>

<p>Isolationism does not work, that&rsquo;s the lesson the greatest generation learned and of which we are being reminded today. Let&rsquo;s heed the lessons well and revert to the wise decisions of prior administrations, Democrat and Republican.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/83/intelligence/the-man-who-saw-the-pandemic-coming">The Man Who Saw The Pandemic Coming</a> by Nautilus is a great article. I&rsquo;ve been writing about the lessons we should learn from COVID-19, the biggest of which is that we are all connected such that a virus on the other side of the globe can find it&rsquo;s way to you in the United States. At the heart of this is putting our heads in the sand in the name of &ldquo;America First,&rdquo; which is the same mentality that existed prior to World War II and lead to World War II. As memories of the atrocities that occurred during during World War II fade we have been moving back in to an isolationist shell that puts all our lives in danger. Just because you don&rsquo;t like the implications of this does not mean ignoring will cause it to go away. It&rsquo;s time to wake up, put on our big boy and girl pants and deal with reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, governments and society by and large are governed by inertia. We don’t change and adapt and evolve very quickly. And we’re barely cognizant as a global society that the world we’re living in today is fundamentally different than the world our species has ever lived in. You know that old saw that if you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will leap out. But if you take that same frog and put it in a pot of ambient water and slowly crank up the temperature, it will stay in that water and boil to death. It loses perspective on the changing environment around it. We’re that frog in the ambient water. We’re oblivious to the conditions that have enabled zoonotic viruses to become integrated into us.</p>

<p>Right now your best chance at survival depends on how the governor of the state you live in is leading the response. It’s as if after Pearl Harbor we left it to the governor of Hawaii to deal with the response.</p>

         	<p>“What American pundits misunderstand when they brandish “market choice” as a weapon against social welfare, then, is that the social safety net does not extinguish human freedom but instead acts as its very condition of possibility (philosophers have called this the distinction between the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom). <strong>Indeed, the best safeguard against the novel coronavirus is the ability to voluntarily withdraw oneself from capitalism.</strong> Therein lies the problem.”</p>

<p>Industries that employ hourly labor make up the majority of capitalism in the United States, and most of the jobs these people fill cannot be done from home. If these people don&rsquo;t get paid, they don&rsquo;t have the freedom to buy. One of the main reasons for the drops in the stock market is the decrease in consumption of items being sold, not because products cannot be produced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moment we no longer have a free press, anything can happen. What makes it possible for a totalitarian or any other dictatorship to rule is that people are not informed; how can you have an opinion if you are not informed? <strong>If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer.</strong> (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider for a moment why the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution restricts the U.S. Government from preventing a free press and from instituting a national religion. National religions and state run press were two tools of tyranny during the 17th and 18th centuries and why the founders felt important to retrict the U.S. Government access to those tools. Unfortunately, I think the far right has found a loophole to the process.</p>

When someone hears &ldquo;wash your hands&rdquo; I think they tend to think &ldquo;after I use the restroom&rdquo; but really it&rsquo;s &ldquo;wash your hands more!&rdquo; How many of us wash/sanitize their hands immediately after getting their credit card back after it is given to a cashier? That&rsquo;s what we are talking about.</p>

         	<p>One addition I would make to <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes">the notes Dave wrote here</a> is that Trump and his entire administration must be held accountable to the consequences of their decisions that caused the slow and ineffective response that resulted in loss of life and damage to the economy. The Republicans will do everything and say everything to make sure Trump is not to blame. Only one Republican, Mitt Romney, appears willing to do what is right for the country rather than what is only right for themselves.</p>

<p>Also, note, the problem here isn&rsquo;t really with Trump, it&rsquo;s with the people in the Republican party who enabled Trump to win their primary and be elected. Unless Republicans, starting with Republican Senators, start to publicly stand up against Trump and LEAD, they should all be held accountable. It&rsquo;s time for Republicans to decided whether or not they are true Americans and true patriots. I so wish John McCain were still alive!</p>

<p>“In one study, Dominic Abrams and his colleagues divided groups of participants into smaller groups based on trivial categories (e.g., groups based on numbers that were randomly assigned to them). Then participants were asked to complete a difficult perceptual task while receiving helpful information from members of either their ingroup or outgroup. <strong>They found that participants did not rely on input from outgroup members even when it would have been useful for them to do so. Instead, they toiled on alone. Abrams and colleagues wrote, “[ Participants] resisted information purely on the basis that it was derived from a category of person to which they did not belong.””</strong> (Emphasis added)</p>

If you say you are going to be totally selfish, in next to no time the person who is totally selfish goes under. You need other people in order to be human. That’s why when they want to punish you they put you in solitary confinement. Because you can’t flourish without other human beings. They give you things that you cannot give yourself, no matter how much money you have. And so we speak of Ubuntu. A person is a person through other persons. And there must have been some people who said, ‘Ah, what a primitive way of thinking.’ It’s the most fundamental law of our being. We flout that—we flout it at our peril.”</p>

<p>On the surface, Roam looks like a cross between a slightly weird wiki and a note-taking tool like Evernote. It’s not. It implements a few key features of 1980s vintage hypertext visions — block-level addressability, transclusion (changes in referenced blocks being “transfer-included” wherever they are cited), and bidirectional linking — that utterly transform the writing experience at the finger-tips level.</p>

We in effect have a civil war in progress initiated by Republicans against Democrats that is now having real consequences and real deaths.</p>

<p>As far as Trump appears to be concerned, Democrats, or anyone who does not agree with him is not an American, not a U.S. citizen and is treated with contempt. This, in the United States of America.</p>

<p>So, how soon until martial law is imposed?</p>

Republicans to date have refused to put the Constitution over party and I have no reason to expect they will act differently.</p>

         	<p>The Raspberry Pi org has released <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">a SD card imager app</a> that is available for Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu. I use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/">balenaEtcher</a> on my Macbook Air to create boot SD cards for my Pis, but the new app from the Raspberry Pi org has the benefit of automatically downloading the appropriate source files rather than my having to manually seek them out. These days I pretty much only drag out the Macbook, which is more than seven years old, when I need to flash a new card. I would rather be able to use of my newest computers to flash images, which is why I decided to try to install it on my Pixellbook. Unforutnately, the install failed, which has me wondering whether I should create a new Ubuntu container and try again.</p>

         	<p>There is a big gap in <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/03/05.html#a183828">how the POTUS should be hired/elected</a> and how he or she is actually elected. One of the first questions I ask myself when determining who to vote for is whether the candidates are competent for the job. What qualifications do they have? Are they capable. In 2016 there was no doubt that Trump was not competent to be POTUS and that immediately disqualified him for the job, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Our country would be much better, I think, if all citizens first considered what are the skills for the job of POTUS and not what that person can do for them. Ultimately the skill is leadership, and leadership requires listening, compromise, persuasion, and humility.</p>

<p>How the Trump administration handles this crisis should factor in whether he is re-elected, but between now and then thousands of people in the United States might die.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The French horn’s register plays in a higher range of the harmonic series (essentially, the notes that are naturally playable without the use of valves), compared to other brass instruments. At higher pitches, it is incredibly sensitive to even small changes in the position of the mouth and air volume. That’s one of the main causes of so many blunders, and the reason brass players joke that the best way to make a trombone sound like a French horn is to stuff your hand into the bell and miss all your notes.</p>

         	<p>The main issue I have with the Democrat primary is that the candidate that I prefer is probably not the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, and I think removing Trump from office is the prime objective. Yet, the candidate that I prefer has a better chance of beating Trump than other candidates. Worse, I do not think Sanders is one of the candidates with the best chance of beating Trump. Still, the big question is whether all Democrats will unite behind whoever is the candidate. While Clinton did not campaign well enough to win in 2016, she was also hurt by Sanders supporters who refused to vote for her and that cannot happen this time or Trump wins re-election.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia’s influence campaign is driven by a desire to “watch us tear ourselves apart,” a senior FBI official said Monday, comments that come after details of a classified briefing to lawmakers became public in news reports, including a claim by the intelligence community’s top election security official that Moscow is interfering with the goal of helping President Donald Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely Russia learned how easy it has become to do this from our actions post 9-11. I think part of the problem is including that lede &ldquo;with the goal of helping President Donald Trump.&rdquo; Perhaps that is true, but the true goal is decreasing United States&rsquo; standing in the world and elevating Putin&rsquo;s Russia, and that alone should be concerning to Trump and his supporters as much as everyone else. Republican refusal to do anything is pure negligence.</p>

         	<p>I think <a href="http://scripting.com/2020/02/20/144006.html?title=notesOnLastNightsDebate">we are hopelessly, intentionally fractured</a>, with factions obsessed with getting their way.  Consequently, there is no agreement about what&rsquo;s most important. Republicans are obsessed with keeping the guy with the R next to his name in the White House even if they don&rsquo;t like him. In their mind any Democrat will do more damage than Trump and anyone raising concerns about Trump are just partisan.</p>

<p>Democrats are NOT united on the priority to remove Trump, rather there appears to be a faction that seems to say, &ldquo;if extreme is the new norm then we have to nominate the most extreme person to win.&rdquo; It appears most Democrats have lost regard for moderates and independents. It&rsquo;s as if they learned the wrong lessons from 2016.</p>

<p>We really need a viable third party candidate; if only the current system wasn&rsquo;t rigged against that happening. Neither party seems really invested in the Constitution, and if you don&rsquo;t recognize Trump as a threat to the Constitution then you conclude he is no different than any other candidate.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://www.stonekettle.com/2020/02/those-who-forget-history.html">Eye opening</a> (or at least it should be!):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have an entire generation of Americans who have grown to adulthood since 9-11 and in those two decades they have never known a single moment when America was not at war. Three thousand Americans died on 9-11, and for that we have embarked on 20 years of revenge. 20 years. Tens, hundreds, of thousands dead as a result. We are trillions of dollars in debt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, and the the whole article ought to be eye opening. One cannot claim themselves a patriot and not know of the documents and their purpose that founded the United States. Waving a flag doesn&rsquo;t matter, nor does supporting the military, nor standing during the national anthem, nor does reciting the pledge of allegiance if you know nothing about the Republic for which it stands!</p>

         	<p>One thing we have learned from the Trump presidency is that there aren&rsquo;t many true conservatives and they don&rsquo;t have any real power, just ideology. If the Executive Branch blatantly ignores the constitution through contempt of the judicial branch, do conservatives think that rises to the level of impeachment and removal? If they are true to &ldquo;conserving&rdquo; the Constitution they ought to otherwise what do they stand for, really?  Trump has already shown he thinks Congress has no authority over him.</p>

The latest version of wiki requires Nodejs 10.x or later and I can only install Nodejs 8.x or older on the server because it is 32-bit.

<blockquote>
<p>A weblog is a hierarchy of text, images, media objects and data, arranged chronologically, that can be viewed in an HTML browser.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You will find many details about the components that make up a weblog, but to me the keys are chronology, usually reverse meaning most recent at the top of the page, voice, generally meaning written by a person, and brevity. The last is not something many consider but I think that good weblog posts are no more than three paragraphs long and I think there is a difference between an essay or a story and a weblog post. A story always has a title, a weblog post may or may not not have a title, and in fact most posts do not have a title.</p>

<p>What became confusing is when people and companies used weblog platforms as content management platforms to create and maintain web sites of an form and fashion and thus if a site were published by Wordpress it automatically was called a blog.</p>

Du Bois predicted that, unless the United States met its obligations to the dignity and equality of all its citizens and ended its enthrallment to corporations, American democracy would fail: “If it is going to use this power to force the world into color prejudice and race antagonism; if it is going to use it to manufacture millionaires, increase the rule of wealth, and break down democratic government everywhere; if it is going increasingly to stand for reaction, fascism, white supremacy and imperialism; if it is going to promote war and not peace; then America will go the way of the Roman Empire.”</p>

I thought the problem was unique to the Microcell, but yesterday I was in a office where the phone only connected to a 4G network and then too the signal strength did not display. So, in December Android began to think there were only LTE networks.</p>

<p>Personal computing tablet style emphasizes simplicity. What is simpler, sliding a mouse along a table top surface and clicking a button to select an object on a screen, or tapping the screen where the object is displayed?</p>

<p>Personal computing tablet style is mobile. Tablets are smaller, lighter and have longer battery life than notebook computers, and they are designed to be typed on via an on-screen keyboard from almost any position, while a notebook is designed to be typed on while placed on a flat surface.</p>

<p>It is my belief that Steve Jobs views the iPad as an implementation of the iPhone Way to personal computing, and because that the iPhone Way is completely opposite to how we have always thought of personal computing, there are a lot of negative reviews of the iPad. You see arguments like “the iPad does not multitask (run mulitiple programs at the same time) so it is not a real computer,” or “the iPad does not have any USB ports to plug in hardware peripherals, so it is not a real computer.” I think both of these intentional design limitations were made to make the iPad simpler to use, because, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1529133/iworry-does-ipad-signal-end-era-open-computing?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+fastcompany/headlines+(Fast+Company+Headlines)">who is to say that our definition of personal computing today will be the same definition ten years from now</a>.</p>

         	<p>Yesterday was the tenth anniversary of the Apple iPad announcement. Back on January 27, 2010 I wrote, &ldquo;<a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/27/has-apple-made-tablets-legit/">Has Apple Made Tablets Legit</a>?&rdquo; and the answer ten years later is a resounding yes. Personally, my iPads are my most used and most important personal computer. Ten years ago the iPad was limited enough to be viewed as a device one uses to read or watch videos, but the current iPads and now iPadOS paired with a keyboard and mouse make it capable of most forms of personal computing. There will always be situations and people demand nothing but a full notebook computer, and that is fine, as Steve Jobs said back then, one can still drive a truck. Happy belated birthday iPad!</p>

<p>P.S. Reading my <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/29/drinking-from-the-ipad-firehose/">past writing</a> on this <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2010/01/30/the-iphone-way/">topic</a>, I realize that embedded in the iPad was Apple&rsquo;s transition to designing their own processors, with their first included in that iPad.</p>

<p>P.S.S. I find it really cool that I can look back and read what I wrote ten years ago. Of course, that only happens because I am paying the bill to continue hosting my old blog. This December I will have been blogging for 21 years.</p>

         	<p>Last week I participated in <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2020/01/20/mobileviews-podcast-314-guests-frank-mcpherson-chris-spera/">the MobileViews podcast</a> and in it we talked about foldable screen devices. I stated my opinion that we ought to think of them as foldable tablets rather than foldable phones. In other words, are there use cases in which we wish we could use a tablet but it&rsquo;s too large to carry around? I think this is important positioning because most people are going to think smartphones are small enough, and foldables are really about making a large screen surface smaller. Coincidentally Microsoft released their SDK for Duo, which is there planned foldable smartphone that they announced last October. The Verge has taken a look at the SDK and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/23/21077846/microsoft-software-sdk-duo-android-phone-pragmatism">explained how that translates to the user experience</a> and I agree it sounds like Microsoft has the right approach. I do wonder, though, about how many cases where users wish they could see Android apps side by side because that appears to be one of the cases Duo will be well suited.</p>

The bug was introduced to the U.S. government by Ronald Reagan. The bug is thinking that compromise and changing one&rsquo;s mind is wrong. Reality is that compromise and changing one&rsquo;s mind is wisdom, which we sorely lack. The root cause of the bug is thinking of the President of the United States as a dictator. You see this clearly in Trump&rsquo;s actions and in his words: &ldquo;Only I can do it.!&rdquo; In the Republic formed by the United States Constitution governing involves compromise and convincing people to change their minds. By design one person can NOT change our government. It&rsquo;s on purpose, and I do not think one can claim themselves a patroit of the United States without embracing this understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My observation of the managers I work for is that when they talk about &ldquo;growth&rdquo; they mean financial (revenue and profit) growth, not at all what is described in this article. Perhaps that is a difference between managers and leaders?</p>

<p>I hired in to a company that believed this and had the culture to back it.

Corporate America lots of managers making lots of money running corporations and very few true leaders.</p>

<p>For me the money quote is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When speaking to engineer leaders we bring up the story about the Netflix engineer above. We do this to emphasize the importance of the environment they are creating. “Creating,” being the operative word here. Environments don’t just happen, they are created through action.</p>

         	<p>How can anybody &ldquo;<a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/presidency/1b2.html">preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States</a>.&rdquo; if they refuse to acknowledge and act under its authority?</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s inability to do so is the prime reason why he should have never been elected nor should be re-elected. It&rsquo;s simple really, either we live under the rule of law established by the Constitution, meaning we have a republic, or we don&rsquo;t meaning we have a dictatorship.</p>

For me this is the primary reason why Trump should be convicted by the Senate, he simply does not care about the Constitution and that alone is the highest violation of his oath and is abuse of power. We should NOT have Presidents who refuse to acknowledge they are <strong>constrained</strong> by the Constitution, which frankly is the <strong>fundamental tenant of conservatism.</strong></p>

<p>Remember when new phones were announced at CES? Hard to believe this was 11 years ago. Reading the article, I think it was a good analysis on my part. The functionality of Synergy has in most ways been integrated into iOS and Android, but ironically the wireless charging that Touchstone had is still not pervasive. My bottom line proved correct, Palm could not get developers to write apps, they were already occupied with iOS and Android. Palm would flounder until being eventually bought by my then employer, Hewlett Packard.</p>

<p>I stand by my opinion that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">WebOS</a> is the best tablet operating system that I have ever used. If you think of it, ChromeOS is in many ways an iteration of WebOS except that it was keyboard first and thus still struggling in a tablet format.</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/01/07/configuring-a-raspberry.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-01-07 21:25:00 -0500">Jan 7, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2019/11/24/mobileviews-podcast-308-raspberry-pi-as-an-ipad-accessory-macbook-pro-thoughts-and-more/">episode 308</a> of the MobileViews podcast Jon Westfall talked about <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/">a blog post</a> describing how to configure a Raspberry Pi 4 as a USB-C accessory for the iPad Pro. The instructions configure the Pi so that you connect an iPad to the Pi using a USB-C cable. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6sDcKo3V8">A video</a> is also available that provides step-by-step instructions, and you can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSlyqo5Q2Q">another video</a> in which the author answers questions that were left in the comments of the original video.</p>

<p>While I found the concept intriguing there is no way I could implement it because it only works if you have the latest iPad Pro that has a USB-C port, which I do not have.</p>

<p>Later I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbvSS8MJm2s">another video</a> done by the author of the original one showing how to install an application called <a href="https://raspap.com/">RaspAP</a> and configure it to be a WiFi hotspot AND a WiFi client at the same time. With this configuration you can connect any iPad, or any other device that has WiFi and then you can SSH in to the Pi from the iPad to have access to a Linux command prompt, from which you could run a number of different applications, programming environments, and utilities.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s actually not too difficult to configure a Raspberry Pi as a WiFi hotspot (access point) and I actually had done so to a small Raspberry Pi Zero W that I have been using as a portable backup for a wiki I maintain of home information. The problem with how I have been using the Pi Zero is that it can only be either a WiFi access point OR a WiFi client, so when configured as an access point the Pi Zero can&rsquo;t connect to my home network or the Internet.</p>

<p>What makes RaspAP better is that it configures a Raspberry Pi so that it can be an access point AND WiFi client at the same time using the same wlan port! I am not sure how this is done because as you may know a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; WiFi access point must have a second wired Ethernet connection to connect to a cable modem and provide Internet access, in such instances the access point routes (or bridges) network traffic between two networks (different IP addressing), one being the WiFi network and the other being the wired network, each requiring one port.</p>

<p>The installation of RaspAP does require connecting the Raspberry Pi to a wired network connection because there is a step that requires resetting the wlan0 interface that will hang if the port is in use. However, after installation, the Pi will connect to your home network and act as an access point for another network at the same time.</p>

<p>Along the way I also found out that I can power the Raspberry Pi 3b+ using the Ravpower  (Model RP-PB043) portable battery that I own, which means that I have a portable, wireless network between an iPad and and a Linux computer that will work anywhere.</p>

<p>How might I use this set up?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I am working on a Nodejs program. I can have Nodejs installed on the Raspberry Pi and I can have all my code also on that Pi, perhaps cloned from a git repo. Let&rsquo;s say I plan to be on a long flight and I want to carry a minimal amount of gear. I can pack my iPad Pro, Raspberry Pi, and the Ravpower in my carry on and when I am able, power up the Pi, leave it in the carry on, and connect to it via WiFi from the iPad. At this point I can then SSH into the Pi and use a text editor (emacs, nano, etc..) to work on my code and test it using nodejs. Of course, you can do this for any other programming environments or compilers that install on the Raspberry Pi and run via the command prompt. (Actually.. one should also be able to VNC into the graphical Raspbarian environment if you need to.)</p>

<p>While I could do the above via the airplane WiFi, doing so costs money and service can be spotty, this network connectivity once configured is available nearly the same way all the time. The &ldquo;remote programmer&rdquo; scenario is just one idea off the top of my head, I am sure there are other uses cases for a configuration such as this. The developer of RaspAP is working to include OpenVPN to make the Pi a VPN endpoint that will provide all secured network communication for all devices that connect to it. You can find more examples for using RaspAP <a href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-awesome">in this Github repo</a>.</p>

<p>“If the President has been willing to withhold foreign military assistance to secure campaign help, how could Americans trust him when he launched a military strike against another country?

Did the President create serious instability for his own needs, possibly even in an effort to divert public attention from the impeachment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>President Trump lies and this is not even disputed by most of his supporters, they just claim he is no different than Obama or any other past president. So, given that we all accept that he lies, how can we trust anything he or his administration says? If we are to go back in to war again, should we not be sure it&rsquo;s for legitimate reasons? If you are a patriot and support our military who puts their life on the line then you should demand the risk of their sacrifice is in support of the interests of the United States and not just the President of the United States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even as the U.S. economy hums along at a favorable pace, there is a vast segment of workers today earning wages low enough to leave their livelihood and families extremely vulnerable. That’s one of the main takeaways from our new analysis, in which we found that 53 million Americans between the ages of 18 to 64—accounting for 44% of all workers—qualify as “low-wage.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current economy is not about employment and it&rsquo;s certainly not about the stock market, it&rsquo;s about wages. Employers do not want to increase wages or provide full time employment.</p>

<p>Candidates for POTUS need to properly identify the problem, talk about whether the current course we are on, which seems targeted at tariffs, is really going to solve the problem, and if not propose solutions.</p>

<p>Note that getting &ldquo;the 1%&rdquo; to pay their share of taxes is NOT going to solve the problem of low income jobs.</p>

The Constitution established a new government designed to <strong>contain power</strong> rather than <strong>provide power</strong>. To be truly patriotic is to be vigilant against re-interpretation of the Constitution as power establishing.

<p>This is a great story about the Atari personal computers. I bought an Atari 800XL when I was in college and used it along with a VT-100 terminal emulator to write programs for my computer science classes in the late 80s. (Back then most of our programming was done on mainframes and we only really needed a terminal.) After being hired out of college I &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; to an Atari 1040ST, which had a GUI similar to the Mac but cost much less. I will always think fondly of Atari due to its role in my early personal computer days.</p>

An Implementation Status table on <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">the Indieweb Micropub clients page</a> suggests the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; is that micro.blog does not support/expose the delete, undelete, or update actions; the only action it appears you can do from a Micropub client is create.</p>

<p>I notice that OmniBear hasn&rsquo;t been updated in more than a year so I might start using Micropublish more, it is even possible to self host the app.</p>

         	<p>Today <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html">Dave Winer writes</a> about simplicity of blogging, what he describes as Flow. The idea is to make writing a new blog post as frictionless as possible.</p>

<p>For me it very quick to write and publish a new blog post, I click the <a href="https://omnibear.com/">OmniBear</a> icon on the Chrome toolbar, write in Content field, and click Post. Boom, I have a new post on my blog.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/12/28/152557.html#a154653">what happens next</a> is a problem. To edit a post I have to go to the micro.blog site and click through many steps rather than see a simple Edit link on the post or the ability to open the post to edit in Bear.</p>

<p>Editing appears to be a weakness of <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients">micropub</a>, most likely because its origin is tied to Twitter which has no concept of editing. We need better ways to originate and edit blog posts.</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/12/18/comcast-data-cap.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-18 11:23:31 -0500">Dec 18, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/plans/">Comcast&rsquo;s 1024 GB (1 TB) monthly data plan</a> (data cap) does not provide enough data for an increasing number of people. The main reason is that an increasing number of services, like Netflix, are streaming video at 4K quality, and in the case of Netflix, it default is to stream at the highest quality. Comcast and I fundamentally disagree, in that <a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/">Comcast says few people will actually be affected</a> by the data cap.</p>

<p>Last week I was shocked when I received an email notice from Comcast that we had consumed 90% of our 1024 data for the month. Why does Comcast default the notification to 90% rather than 50%? The higher data consumption appears to coincide with an automatic and &ldquo;free&rdquo; increase of our bandwidth to 100 Mbps last month. Comcast says an increase in bandwidth does not automatically lead to increase data usage, but given that Netflix, and I assume other apps, default to the highest quality video I suspect we ended up viewing more 4K video this month than we have in the past.</p>

<p>Ever since receiving the email notification I have been closely monitoring our data usage, comparing network traffic stats to Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter, and I think the usage meter is accurate, unlike an issue that occurred in October where the meter was wrongly indicating drastically higher consumption. In general, I think Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter is insufficient in that it only shows a monthly total. If you have a cap and will automatically charge overages, I think you must at least provide daily stats. The worst part is that home owners don&rsquo;t have a good or easy to use tools of their own to confirm Comcast&rsquo;s data, leaving consumers at a disadvantage when trying to dispute Comcast&rsquo;s data.</p>

<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/estimator/">Comcast&rsquo;s Usage Estimate calculator</a> says a HD stream consumes 1.7 GB of data per hour, where as Netflix says that 1 hour of HD consumes 3 GB. Comcast and Netflix agree that one hour of 4K video consumes around 8 GB per hour. Using Netflix&rsquo;s rate that HD consumes 3 GB per hour, Comcast&rsquo;s claim that you can stream 21 GB per day of HD video is not correct. At 3 GB per hour, that&rsquo;s 11 hours per day for 1024 GB per month.</p>

<p>Last night I watched 1 hour of CW Seed on my Apple TV that consumed 6 GB of data, suggesting to me that stream is UHD quality rather than HD and I don&rsquo;t see a way to control the quality in the CW Seed app.</p>

<p>If you only have one video stream in a house, 11 hours is probably enough, but if you increase that to two streams, you are down to 5 hours per day per stream and that is not hard to exceed, particularly if you unknowingly watch some video in 4K. If you stream all video at 4K you can only watch a little over 4 hours per day, which is tight for one stream, and impossible for two.</p>

<p>You can control the quality of the video streams for some services, but you have to do so per application/service. For example, you can <a href="https://ipstarbroadband.com.au/support/how-to-reduce-netflix-data-usage/">configure Netflix to only stream at Standard quality</a>, but who wants to do that if they spent money on a HD TV? And, if you use more than one app, as many do with say Disney+ or Amazon Prime, you might not be able to change the video quality or you will have to spend a lot of time changing settings in indivdiual apps. And again&hellip; you spent good money on a high quality TV, you rightly expect to be able to see the best video!</p>

<p><a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/unlimited/">Comcast does provide an unlimited plan</a> for an additional $50 per month. The current cap appears intended to drive more, if not most, home owners to pay that $50 more per month. (I personally don&rsquo;t do online gaming, but I bet that can consume a significant amount of data per month). In my case, Comcast kindly increased our bandwidth to 100 Mbps at no additional cost&hellip;. but that&rsquo;s not entirely true since I now appear to be in the position of having to pay $50 more per month!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I continue to monitor <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/internet-data-consumption">my home Internet data usage</a> closely since receiving notice from Comcast that we are near the 1024 GB monthly cap. I enabled Traffic Stats on my home router so that I can compare that to Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter. Traffic stats is an approximation because it doesn&rsquo;t only show traffic coming in from the Internet but also traffic within my home network, but I think it can give me an indication of whether Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter is accurate. (If caps are going to be a thing, Home Routers need a feature that shows download and upload traffic to the Internet.)</p>

<p>After the first day, it seems the Comcast usage meter is accurate. If that is true, somehow we doubled our Internet data usage and the only thing I know changed is that our bandwidth jumped to 100 Mbps in the last month. The usage meter only shows data going back to June, so it looks to me like Comcast just started enforcing this data cap in our area, probably coinciding with the increase to 100 Mbps. Something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, my usage as around 775 GB per month and with no other change other than the bandwidth increase I don&rsquo;t know what we have been doing differently. It&rsquo;s as if Netflix detected I have more bandwidth and decided on its own to use it and I don&rsquo;t see an option to throttle it back to 1080 or 720.</p>

<p>The data cap is annoying, and frankly I think the lack in detail in Comcast&rsquo;s reporting is a problem that needs to be addressed by regulation. If you have a cap you can&rsquo;t just report a monthly total, I think you have to at least show daily usage. Given that increase in streaming providers supporting 4K video, 1024 GB (1 TB) per month is really not enough.</p>

<p>Comcast will be happy to remove the cap if I pay them $50 more per month. I will probably end up paying that for the benefit of not needing to constantly monitor data usage.</p>

We ought to have substantive conversation about what is America and how it might be great, but we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Here is a problem, greatness is not something one can self-declare. My constantly saying that I am great does not make me so, that makes me arrogant. Greatness is only determined by people other than oneself, and the same is true for countries. This is something Americans don&rsquo;t seem to understand, but it is a truth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think most people add the words &ldquo;for me&rdquo; to the end of MAGA, which ironically is the exact opposite to <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/documents/ask-not.htm">a quote from a Democrat President, John F.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Today I received an email from Comcast informing me that we have consumed 90% of our 1 TB data alotment for the month. While I had been vaguely aware that <a href="https://dataplan.xfinity.com/faq/">Comcast has data caps</a>, I had not encountered an issue with it until today.</p>

<p>What I find odd is that we have been averaging about 650 GB of data per month, and now mid-month Comcast is saying we have already consumed about 900 GB? What changed? Frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I noticed that mid last month our Internet download speed increased from around 70 mbps to 100 mbps. There seems to be a relationship between the increase in our bandwidth and how much Comcast claims we are now using. I didn&rsquo;t ask for the bandwidth increase. I am wondering whether now that our speed is faster the streaming services we use have flipped over to higher data rate video streaming than we&rsquo;ve been using previously?</p>

<p>What is frustrating is that the data usage meter Comcast provides is just a total consumption per month, it doesn&rsquo;t show me a per day or even per week breakdown. In fact, I don&rsquo;t know how I have any way to confirm that what Comcast is claiming I am consuming is what I am actually using!</p>

<p>Comcast provides 2 months of &ldquo;free&rdquo; data overage before they will start charging me $10 for each 50 GB we go over the cap per month, so I don&rsquo;t have to do anything drastic right now. Right now I don&rsquo;t even know how to begin to fight this thing, I am going to have to study the topic and see if there is something that I can implement on my end to show how much data we actually do consume per month.</p>

         	<p>I needed to buy a new smartphone this week that I did not want to spend much money on because I really just needed it to handle phone calls and text messages, so I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Unlocked-Smartphone-T-Mobile-MetroPCS/dp/B071ZDQ6MV/">this Nokia 6</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my first phone from the new Nokia and I have to say that I am really impressed. Solid construction with a very nice display. Best of all so far is the Battery life&hellip; it&rsquo;s been running for more than 30 hours since I charged it and still has 40% left&hellip; although I don&rsquo;t have many apps (particularly apps like Facebook) installed, so that may be a contributor.</p>

<p>A bonus with this phone is that it is dual SIM, unlocked and it can also use a SD card, although if you do you cannot use the second SIM as it uses the same slot.</p>

<p>While the phone ships with Android 7.1.1. installed it upgraded to Android 9 immediately upon set up. It is stock Android with only an FM Radio and My Phone apps added to the standard apps you find with Android.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think this phone will upgrade to Android 10 and Google may not be pushing security updates for Androids 9, but I have found this to be a great phone for the price!</p>

         	<p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/12/11/does-not-look.html">Earlier this week</a> we learned that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chat</a> was generally available to Android users, and at the time it did not look to me like it was working with AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>As it happened, I set up a new phone on AT&amp;T this week and I was surprised to find that when I started Messages I saw a message saying Chat messaging was available. I then went in to Google Play and saw that the Carrier Services app was installed on the phone.</p>

<p>I still didn&rsquo;t see the feature available on my Pixel 2, however, so I thought, what if I searched for Carrier Services in Google Play and tried to install it? Turns out that I found it and was able to install it and after that the Chat services connected and was functional.</p>

<p>I now have two phones with the feature enabled, which allows me to test it. You will know if you are using chat if you see &ldquo;Chat message&rdquo; displayed in the input box, otherwise you see &ldquo;Text message&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I find the chat functions similar to Facebook Messenger. If you are chatting back and forth you see the &hellip; indicating a response is being typed. The messages and pictures appear near instantly.</p>

<p>BTW, the two phones I have are on Android 10 and 9, so I know at least one generation older than the current will be able to use the service. I am looking forward to seeing whether/how soon my friends get the service.</p>

         	<p>I found that <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/12/11/google-keep-assistant-notes/">the new Notes and Lists service</a> is now available in the Google Assistant settings on my Pixel 2. The service not only supports Google Keep but also other apps including Any.do, which I just recently started using as my personal list manager.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s odd that the service is intended for Notes and Lists, indicating it was probably original conceived for integration with Keep. With it configured to work with Any.do, it doesn&rsquo;t appear as though I can create and store notes. I don&rsquo;t doubt that I could create notes if I set it up with Keep.</p>

         	<p>Today electing a president is not about issues, nor is it about changing minds, nor is it about who looks better and sounds better of TV. The election is not about a personal popularity contest. Electing a president is now simply about opposition. In short, there is no middle ground just as the middle class has grown increasingly small.</p>

<p>If you identify Republican you are likely going to only vote for Republicans because you think all Democrats are crazy and will destroy the country. Likewise, if you identify Democrat you will only vote Democrat. If you really don&rsquo;t like your candidate you will not vote, or write in Mickey Mouse rather than cast a vote for the opposing party.</p>

<p>The consequence is that the candidates only say what their &ldquo;base&rdquo; wants to  hear, and it doesn&rsquo;t even matter of what is said is true. Candidates don&rsquo;t really try to change people&rsquo;s minds. In this environment, do we really need debates?  Worse, there is little for few remaing, truly &ldquo;independent&rdquo; voters to hear, and frankly doing a bunch of research is too much work for the average voter. Increasing numbers of these disenfranchised voters will simply sit out.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think Democrats think the lesson learned from 2016 is to focus on their base and ignore the middle because they think there are more liberal/progressives voters than conservative, Republicans, or independents. An extreme shift left is viewed by their opposition as further evidence of crazy Democrats.</p>

<p>The authors of the U.S. Constitution foresaw this type of fanaticism that democracy enables and thus created a structure to prevent it. Unfortunately, over time political idealogies have trumped preservation of the Republic concentrating more power within the Presidency. A party aligned, rubber stamping Congress and Supreme Court is a defacto dictatorship and this is effectly today&rsquo;s U.S. government.</p>

         	<p>Upon further review it looks like my Pixel 2 doesn&rsquo;t know how to display the signal strength when the phone connects to the AT&amp;T Microcell in our home. When I leave the house it displays fine, but when I come back and it connects to the Microcell I actually see it show all bars and then the bars disappear. Perhaps it&rsquo;s due to the fact that the microcell only provides 3G data, which I don&rsquo;t care about because I use WiFi for data at home. In the the number of bars don&rsquo;t really matter so long as my call connections work and don&rsquo;t drop, but it&rsquo;s annoying.</p>

When he is not running for President Bernie has an I by his name, and frankly I see him as using the party. It is fair to say Bernie is a Progressive, but that does not necessarily make him a Democrat. If people thought about it, they would also realize that a person who considers themself a Conservative does not necessarily mean they are a Republican, nor should one assume that a person calls themself a Republican that means they are a Conservative.</p>

         	<p>My computing muse, Jerry Pournelle, is credited for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Pournelle#Pournelle's_first_law">Pournelle&rsquo;s law</a>: &ldquo;One user, one CPU&rdquo; or &ldquo;One user, at least one CPU.&rdquo; The law is a statement about personal computers and the computers of the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s that were time shared amongst multiple users.</p>

<p>Pournelle&rsquo;s first law somewhat describes my interest in the Raspberry Pi. The Pi, along with most &ldquo;Internet of Things&rdquo; is a variation of Pournelle&rsquo;s law to wit: &ldquo;One application one CPU.&rdquo;</p>

         	<p>While listening to <a href="http://www.mobileviews.com/blog/2019/11/24/mobileviews-podcast-308-raspberry-pi-as-an-ipad-accessory-macbook-pro-thoughts-and-more/">the latest MobileViews Podcast</a> I heard Jon Westfall describe using the Raspberry Pi 4 as an accessory to an iPad Pro. The key component of the solution is the USB-C ports on the iPad Pro and the Raspberry Pi 4 because they are used to power the Raspberry Pi and provide network communication between the iPad and the Raspberry Pi. I am surprised that the iPad&rsquo;s USB-C power output meets the Pi 4&rsquo;s higher power input requirements, however I learned that the latest firmware upgrade for the Pi 4 includes a low power option along with Ethernet over USB, which are  key for this working.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://youtu.be/IR6sDcKo3V8">a YouTube video</a> that shows the configuration and a link to <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2019/11/02/pi4-usb-c-gadget/">a web page</a> that provides more details about the configuration.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Raspberry Pi Zero W in a similar manner except that I power it using USB battery and access it via WiFi when the Pi Zero is configured as a wireless access point. The result provides me access to Linux terminal apps but does not provide simultaneous access to the Internet.</p>

<p>I like the idea of using the Raspberry Pi 4 as described, but in my case I would need to buy a new iPad Pro with the USB-C port. Capabilities such of this do make the idea of upgrading to the latest iPad Pros more compelling.</p>

         	<p>I bought <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/raspberry-pi-4">the Raspberry Pi4</a> this past week and I&rsquo;ve installed it in a <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">Flirc Raspberry Pi4</a> case. Beside the fact that the Flirc case looks really nice, the case provides passive cooling of the CPU. Reviews of the Pi4 when it first released indicated it ran hot enough under load to hit the 82&rsquo;C threshold that causes the CPU speed to throttle down. The Raspberry Pi Foundation as released a firmware update that improves cooling and so far with the firmware and the Flirc case the top temp I&rsquo;ve seen is 44&rsquo;C.</p>

<p>The reason why the Raspberry Pi4 runs hotter is that it has a faster ARM Cortex-A72 CPU processor, as much as 4 GB of RAM, and a USB-C power supply. I am using daenerys (my name for this computer) to type this post and I am finding it surprisingly useful for web applications. Gmail, with its heavy use of Javascript is unbearable in older models, but is actually usable on the Pi4.</p>

<p>For a little under $100, the Pi4 is defintely worth being a child&rsquo;s first computer. I think it can also be a very servicable Linux server, running Raspbian Buster Lite, a variant of Debian Buster, for home projects.</p>

<p>Right now I don&rsquo;t any plans for daenerys but I&rsquo;ll be keeping my eyes open for any opportunities. Daenerys is my fifth Raspberry Pi. The first model I bought was the Pi2, which I have connected to a seven inch screen and serves a desk clock that shows my schedule, CNN newsfeed, current weather, and four day weather forcase. I have a Pi3 running Tiddlyserver that I am using to for a family wiki, and another running Taiga, which is a project management app. I also have a Pi Zero W that use to host a portable copy of the family wiki.</p>

         	<p>“In the 1700s, philosophers like John Locke argued that public life and politics should be separated from gratitude. Civic relations should be based on rules and laws—not gifts, favors, or quid pro quo—with the participation and consent of the governed. Private life, philosophers suggested, could still be ordered by gifts and gratitude in the more limited arenas of families and friends. <strong>Thus, constitutions eventually replaced kingly rulers, and laws distributed political benefits through the will of the people.</strong>”  (emphasis mine)</p>

If you failed to return the ruler’s favor—such as not paying a tribute or refusing to send your son to serve in the army—you were branded an “ingrate.” Ingratitude was disloyalty and sometimes treason, crimes punishable by denial of favor, reduction in rank, seizure of property, enslavement, prison, exile, or death.”</p>

         	<p>President Trump simply believes that he as president cannot commit a crime. He believes that a president is above the law. Trump&rsquo;s belief is the logical conclusion of decades of expansion of presidential powers that started with Vietnam.</p>

<p>How far have we fallen? At the beginning of my life President Nixon resigned before he was impeached because he broke the law. Nixon knew he would be impeached because he knew and accepted that Americans did not believe a President was above the law. We now have President Trump who believes that more Americans now accept that a President is above the law and believes that Americans today find loyalty to him and loyalty to party more important than loyalty to the Republic.</p>

<p>All presidents in my life time have desired more power. The real problem has been Congress&rsquo; abdication of it&rsquo;s prime constitutional responsibility to be a check on the presidency. At root of this abdication is the transformation of Congress as representative of all U.S. citizens to only representative of the majority party. Rather than upholding and defending the U.S. Constitution, Congress has become all about enabling and implementing a Republican or Democrat ideology.</p>

<p>What I find ironic is that I think the core belief of conservatism is that &ldquo;abosolute power corrupts absolutely&rdquo; and yet Republican conservatives have been the prime architects of the expansion of powers to the president. Conservatives should be truly republican but do not act like it, but rather tend to act more as anarchists.</p>

<p>Worst of all is that too many U.S. citizens do not care that this is happening! Too many people do not know the Constitution nor appreciate the fundamental reasons for why the U.S. form of republican democracy was designed and adopted. These people pledge allegiance to a flag <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/us/no-brainer-trump-tweets-support-for-amendment-banning-flag-burning-1.586168">as if the flag is the thing</a> rather than a symbol of the real thing, our way of life enabled by the Constitution.</p>

<p>What has been taking place over the course of my life time is the ascendency of a U.S. monarchy or dictatorship under the veneer of the Presidency. If you are truly a U.S. patriot your loyalty should be to the &ldquo;Republic for which it stands&rdquo;, which means the Constitution that defines the republic.</p>

         	<p>“The worst cost of factions comes when they capture the state for rent-seeking—for the purpose of directing the state’s power for the benefit of themselves, and for the exploitation and even the oppression of others. But because this problem is “sown” in human nature, which is permanent, so, too, is the problem. Hence there can be no end—no conceivable end—to the need to limit government by circumscribing its powers that can be captured by factions. This is true even—actually, especially—when the power of the state is wielded in response to a majority faction.”</p>

         	<p>Google has released <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/chrome-os-version-78">Chrome OS Version 78</a> and it is available so I installed it on my Pixelbook. One significant change is that <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-78-stable-channel-arrives-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Google changed the file format it uses to backup Linux apps</a> and because of that I suspect it will not be able to restore prior backups using the old format. If you backup Linux apps on your Chromebook you will want to run a new backup as soon as possible.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/11/impeachment">The Heritage Guide to The Constitution:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been the general American practice regarding criminal law to grant considerable discretion to prosecutors, so that by analogy one could argue that the House has complete discretion to decide whether to initiate impeachment proceedings. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist No. 77, argued that the nation would find &ldquo;republican&rdquo; safety from a presidential abuse of power by the mode of his election and by his &ldquo;being at all times liable to impeachment.&rdquo; There is no doubt that the Framers saw impeachment as a part of the system of checks and balances to maintain the separation of powers and the republican form of government. <strong>The implication is that when the President (or other impeachable official) has committed an impeachable offense, the Members of the House, bound by the oaths they take to uphold the Constitution, are under a particular obligation to deal with the miscreant&rsquo;s offenses, irrespective of whether their bill of impeachment may or may not lead to a conviction in the Senate.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely, this is why a Republican-led House initiated impeachment proceedings on Bill Clinton. Why should the current Democrat-led House not be bound to the same obligation to hold proceedings on President Trump.</p>

         	<p>One thing I found interesting in Microsoft&rsquo;s announcements yesterday is the starting price for the Surface Pro 7 at $749, lower than other Surface Pros that I can remember. My guess is that model will have low end specs, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/02/surface-pro-7-vs-the-pro-6/">Engadet shows</a> are an Intel Core i3, 4 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage.

         	<p>I watched <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/microsoftevent">the 2019 Microsoft Surface event</a> and I have to admit that I like what I saw of the Surface Neo and Duo. Microsoft has basically taken the concept of using two desktop computer monitors to a mobile device, the question is whether that works with large or small screens. I also wonder about their durability, but we have had foldback screens on notebook PCs for a long time now, so that shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.</p>

<p>I also think <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview">the Surface Pro X</a> looks very nice, I can see it as a decent competitor to the iPad Pro, but the $999 starting price is too high. My reaction first reaction to it is that it looks like what the Google Pixel Slate should have been.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s ironic that despite Microsoft&rsquo;s cloud first/mobile first strategy, they are developing some really nice looking hardware.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel">achilles&rsquo; heel</a> of the U.S. Constitution are political parties. The model of government the U.S. Constitution established was designed to forge a republic of &ldquo;United States&rdquo; from southern and northern states, within the context of slavery. The Constitution was not written to address and mitigate the power of political parties and thus I see the possibility of a constitutionally enabled dictatorship.</p>

<p>How would a constitutionally enabled dictatorship look like? First, you neuter the electoral college. Next, you remove all power from the minority party in Congress. Next, you have 60% of the U.S. Senate made up of party of the President and more than half of the House also the same party as the President. Finally, you have all Supreme Court justices of the same party as the president. All three branches align to one party and then Congress and the Supreme Court do nothing more than rubber stamp anything the President requests and you have in place a dictatorship.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is not supposed to be political but it now totally is ever since the Reagan administration.</p>

<p>The Congress is supposed to be the primary means of checks and balances but that too has turned into nothing more than alignment with the President since Vietnam.</p>

<p>The fourth estate, the press, is now corporately owned and no longer fulfills its defacto role in government given to it by the first amendment.</p>

<p>And finally, we seem to no longer really have U.S. Citizens, instead we are people who see themselves as Conservative or Liberal, Republican or Democrat.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need a civil war. Democracy in the U.S. will fail without a single shot fired no matter the interpretation of the second amendment.</p>

In a world where people both have too high and too low expectations for professional sport coaches and managers, the common playbook front offices take when teams under-perform is to fire the manager.</p>

<p>Yes, change is needed, and yes, it is easier to fire one person, the manager, and not the team. But, Maddon is not the reason why the Cubs did not make the playoffs. First, and foremost the reason is that Cub players did not do their job. The same players who once ground out at bats in 2016 where doing nothing more than swing for the fences all this year. Second, the Cubs lineup is nothing but the same style hitter, with no diversity on the bench or apparently in the farm system, and the talent, that&rsquo;s on the Theo Epstein and the front office.</p>

<p>Frankly, up until this point, what Epstein and the front office have done is succeed with the easy decisions and fail at the hard decisions. How hard is it to tank year after year and stock pile on draft picks that every talent scout in America says is a good bet? When Maddon became available, was it really hard to quickly decide to drop Ricky Renteria and sign Maddon?</p>

<p>Be careful for what you ask for, you just might get it. Now Epstein has to make one of the most important decisions of his tenure, who to hire to replace the manager that guided your team to the first World Series in 108 years. David Ross might be a good guy in the clubhouse, but will he have the players attention any more than Maddon? Will Joe Girardi be too hard? Who Epstein hires is crucial towards getting the most out of all the the talented players that are now starting to enter the end of their contracts.</p>

<p>Worse of all, the attention on hiring the next manager redirects attention away from the real heavy lifting of the offseason, which is to make changes to the lineup so that you get more professional at bats. Changing the lineup means moving one of the core players who won the World Series, which is something Epstein has refused to do to date. If you only replace the manager and keep everything else the same, why should we expect a different result?</p>

<p>On Saturday Epstein announced that Maddon will not be returning. If next year is no better, who will be the scapegoat then? You can&rsquo;t fire the entire team.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The common denominator for all my favorite professional sports teams is that they were losers during my childhood. The Green Bay Packers were the siberia of the NFL during the 70s and 80s until Reggie White started playing for them in 1993 and three years later won the Super Bowl. Ever since 1993 the Packers have been at or near the top of the NFL.</p>

<p>The Chicago Cubs were the epitome of &ldquo;lovable losers&rdquo; for a century. Even though the Cubs flirted with chances to make it to the World Series in 1984, 1989, and 2003 but it hasn&rsquo;t been until the last five years that they have consistently been at or near the top of the league, and you know they won it all in 2016.</p>

<p>Like the Green Bay Packers, the Detroit Red Wings were also once the dominant team in the NHL but during the 70s and 80s they were known as the &ldquo;dead Wings.&rdquo; The owners had to give away cars to get people to come to their games. In 1997 the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup, and of my favorite teams they have won more championships in my life time, winning again in 1998, 2002, and 2008. Since the calendar turned to the 2010s the Wings have been in a rebuilding phase.</p>

<p>Finally, the Detroit Pistons where also perenial losers during my childhood but where the first of my faves that I witnessed winning a championship in 1989, and again in 1990 and 2004. Frankly, the championship they won in 2004 is one of the most gratifying because nobody really expected it and they upset the perenial champion Los Angeles Lakers. Like the Red Wings, the Pistons are rebuilding but apppear to be nearing returning to the tops of their league sooner than the Wings.</p>

<p>Over my life time I&rsquo;ve seen the long road it takes to get from basement to top floor of a professional sports league. I&rsquo;ve seen how it takes for a team to learn how to be a champion, particularly from the Red Wings who had huge playoff failures after being the best team in their league the entire season.</p>

<p>Of all my favorite teams, the Cubs have the most talent and I expect will have chances to win championships again in the foreseeable future. The MLB&rsquo;s farm system enables a franchise to have more control over its future if they have the right leadership. The NHL is similar, which is why theirs and the MLB front offices have such a huge influence on their long term success, much more than in the NFL and NBA that seems to depend much more on health and luck.</p>

<p>I am dissappointed that the Chicago Cubs will not make the playoffs this year. I will always love the Cubbies, win or lose, but I much better like where they are now, a very good team that can disappoint than a bad team that surprises.</p>

<p>In order to successfully avert the climate catastrophe, we quickly need to solve our collective action problem. We have to find a way to cooperate internationally, to reduce rather than expand. Humanity’s greatest challenge in the 21ˢᵗ century is not the climate — it’s us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To achieve cooperation we have to get over the origin of sin: the illusion of separateness that leads to supremacy. This problem is particularly hard because the United States is founded on supremacy by way of colonialism and slavery. Supremacy is so unconscious it permeates all aspects of our life, including American Christianity.</p>

<p>To all of this we have to open our eyes.</p>

         	<p>I watched the Apple iPhone event this afternoon and found all the emphasis on the cameras to be over the top. I know that Google has received praise for the cameras in the Pixels so I get that Apple wanted to proclaim loudly they have the best camera. I am not a camera nerd, all I want is the camera on my phone to take decent pictures, which it does. I don&rsquo;t care about all the whizzywigs, and I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a smartphone because it has the best camera. It feels like Apple is still playing the features game to convince people to throw down $1k on their phones, case in point, the portion of the event that got into the details of the A13 processor.</p>

<p>When I look at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/10/iphone-11-vs-the-competition/">this comparison</a> of phones, I am drawn to the Pixel 3A XL because it has enough features for the lowest price.</p>

         	<p>Home Run hitting is vulnerable to breaking down. Combine that fact with an aging starting rotation and an inconsistent bullpen and you have a summary of the Chicago Cub&rsquo;s last two seasons.</p>

<p>The Cubs currently have 5 batters with 20 or more home runs, and one more, Jason Heyward at 19. No Cubs hitter has a batting average of .300 or better, Anthony Rizzo  is hitting .286. Even if you add Ben Zobrist to the mix, the Cubs lineup is too much the same making it easy to defend.</p>

<p>I understand the resistance in parting ways with the talent that got you the World Series three years ago, but I think it should be clear now that unless there are some diferent players in the lineup next year, you are going to end up with the same result.</p>

<p>Many will put blame on the manager, but he is not the person responsible for the roster, that lies with the front office. You clearly see a bias towards a single style of player that is good but not diverse enough, and that really doesn&rsquo;t give Madden many options to change things up.</p>

<p>Ownership has some hard decisions to make during the off season. It&rsquo;s easy to decide whether or not to spend money, it is much harder to decide whether the people running your team know how to change and if you do replace them, with whom?</p>

<p>I expect the Cubs to replace Madden because that is the easy choice that just about every team makes at this point. A different leadership style might spark a different emotional result, but it won&rsquo;t change how teams pitch to the Cubs.</p>

         	<p>I’ve been using Chromecast ever since Google first started selling them, and upgraded to the Ultras when they became available. One is attached to each of our two TVs, however I also have an Apple TV connected to the basement TV. I primarily use the Apple TV because I find the apps are better, for example the MLB app has a catch up feature only available on Apple TV.</p>

<p>I do occasionally stream ball games using the Chromecast on the Living Room TV but it has he annoying behavior of performance degrading after a couple hours of streaming. All of a sudden what I am watching starts stuttering and becomes unwatchable.</p>

<p>I don’t have solid evidence, but I suspect the Chromecast is overheating to the point after a few hours the performance suffers. The OS on the device might be throttling down performance to protect the CPU. The Chromecast is very hot when I touch it. I probably should get an HDMI extension to move it further away from the back of the TV.</p>

<p>Given my experience, if someone is in the market for a streaming video device I recommend the Apple TV unless you find the price prohibitive. I think the UI is good and it has had solid performance.</p>

         	<p>Today I discovered <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, and the web site provides a nice VirtualBox appliance to easily download and test it. What I find is that it runs very well in VirtualBox, better than the Debian installs that I have built in it.</p>

<p>It functions differently than Debian, particularly package management and installing apps, so there is a learning curve.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/a-comment-on/">A year ago</a> I signed up for <a href="https://exist.io/">Exist</a> in search of an application that would help me analyze the data I Collect in Google Fit. Unfortunately, it only imports a few months of historical data from Fit so I needed to wait until now to see the year over year benefit.</p>

<p>Now I can easily tell that I am walking less this week but more than last  year. I can easily see whether my monthly activity is above, at, or below my average. Exist also provides a way to track my moods and provide tags.</p>

<p>A few things that I wish Exist provided are a direct way to enter sleep information, similar to mood tracking. I don&rsquo;t use devices to track my sleep but I would like to simply be able to enter the times I went to bed and got up and provide a rating for how I think I slept. Not scientific, but a start.</p>

<p>I would like it to integrate with food tracking apps, or provide a direct way. Right now I am using LoseIt mostly to track carbs.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish it provided me a way to create my own queries/reports of data.</p>

<p>Overall I am happy with the service and can recommend it. Web, Android and iOS applications are available.</p>

         	<p>The Chicago Cubs have one of the best home records and one of the worst road records, and they have the best run differential in their division. People seem to be scratching their head over how the same team can be so good at home and so bad on the road. The problem is not the hitting, although they could be more consistent. To me the problem is the bullpen, they are giving up too many runs in the 6 thru 9th innings. Nobody in the pen is reliable.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago the bullpen wasn’t so important because starting pitchers pitched more innings and more often completed games. Now, starting pitchers are only expected to pitch six innings and that means you got have more pitching than ever before.</p>

<p>The Cubs overall pitching staff is not good enough. You might see an uptick in performance if they make the playoffs because the starters tend to go longer and you tend to narrow the pen down to a handful of pitchers, but I don’t expect the Cubs to get beyond be first round if they do make the playoffs.</p>

<p>I don’t know what specific things the Cubs need to do for next year. I don’t think the problem is with the managing or coaching, it seems to point to the talent in pitching. Lester and Hamel will be a year older and there doesn’t appear to be any replacements coming from the minors. The window on the talent the Cubs do have is getting smaller and it will be a shame if they only make it to one World Series.</p>

         	<p>Each year we try to celebrate our wedding anniversary on vacation to spend time together. This year we traveled to Marquette, Michigan, stayed at the <a href="http://www.thelandmarkinn.com/">Landmark Inn</a>, took a tour of <a href="https://www.picturedrocks.com/">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a> in Munising, and then on our way back spent an evening at <a href="https://www.midarkskypark.org/">Headlands International Dark Sky Park</a> near Mackinaw City.</p>

<p>Here are pictures that we took during the trip:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D3ZwuDngt3mz9Brb6">Headlands International Dark Sky Park</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I defintely recommend all three venues. Pictured Rocks might be the closest thing I&rsquo;ve seen to the Grand Canyon east of the Mississippi. The Dark Sky Park is a great place for star gazing, just be sure the moon isn&rsquo;t too bright and you have clear skies.</p>

<p>A President needs to get Congress to pass legislation to implement his or her plans. Consequently we gauge their potential success of whether the President&rsquo;s party has a majority in the House and Senate.  Reality is that this rarely happens, and even so there may be members of the President&rsquo;s own party who don&rsquo;t agree, therefore what we need to evaluate is how persuasive a candidate is and whether they can lead compromise.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we really tend to think of our candidates as dictators and that has manifested in Donald Trump. The founders did not intend Presidents to have such power, the representative republic they established vested Congress with job of governing by representing the citizens (House) and the states (Senate). In fact, through the electoral college, the Congress was intended to ultimately decide who is President.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>23 Now before faith came, we were imprisoned and guarded under the law until faith would be revealed. 24 Therefore the law was our disciplinarian until Christ came, so that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer subject to a disciplinarian, 26 for in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. 27 As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 28 There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. - <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A23-28&amp;version=NRSV">Galations 3:23-28</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too radical? Perhaps so for religions and countries birthed by Anglo-Saxons. If you call yourself a Christian, how do you imagine the Kingdom of God that Jesus constantly talked about looks like? Being one in Christ does NOT mean we are all the same like #AllLivesMatter. Being one in Christ means we see Christ in everyone and everything through our different skin colors, nationalities, and genders.</p>

<p>Regrets, should we have them, are better addressed in the moment I think. We can apologize for our mistakes. We can make amends when we’ve hurt people.

<p>So, when Trump says &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; one should ask, who determines whether America is great? How do they determine that America is great?</p>

<p>Likewise, I don&rsquo;t think I can declare that I am not racist. I hope I am not, but I think only those of other races could determine whether or not I am racist by my actions and my character.</p>

<p>White man declaring he is not racist does not make it so, or does one white man saying another white man is not racist does not make it so.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/06/24/in-a-youtube.html">The Risk Of Identifying As A Platform</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/06/24/in-a-youtube.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-24 10:50:00 -0500">Jun 24, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In a YouTube video recently posted, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&amp;v=W5g4sPi1wd4">Bill Gates said</a> something along the line of his greatest failure was to not lead Microsoft to produce a mobile operating system that would have been as successful as Android.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Everything-Windows-Mobile/dp/B002IKLN6K">I had an up front view of Microsoft&rsquo;s mobile operating systems</a> in the early 2000s and for Microsoft to create an Android would have required something akin to a labotomy. The Microsoft of the early 2000s saw itself as a platform company, that platform being Windows, and as a consequence, its prime objective was to protect the platform because to do so was to protect its existence.</p>

<p>To make something like Android Microsoft would have had to be willing to create a new platform rather than try to extend a desktop platform to mobile, which was doomed for failure. Microsoft could not fathom creating a second platform because to do so, in their mind, was to put Windows at risk. (Microsoft also applied the same thinking to the Internet.)</p>

<p>In my opinion the most important thing Satya Nadella did when we took over Microsoft is return to Microsoft&rsquo;s roots as a software developer and move away from identifying itself as a platform company. As a software developer Microsoft does not see it&rsquo;s entire existence depending on Windows, which allows it to embrace other platforms such a making a robust version of Microsoft Office for iOS and Android and even to integrate Linux with Windows.</p>

<p>Had Microsoft not got drunk on the Windows platform, starting with Windows 95, it might have been willing to embrace the Internet and mobile more fully and maintained itself as, in Bill Gate&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;the&rdquo; leading software company rather than &ldquo;a&rdquo; leading software company. It&rsquo;s easy to get drunk on the amount of money successful platforms provide and appear to provide forever.</p>

<p>Platforms are an institution, and most institutions naturally expend tremendous effort on self preservation. In my opinion the only way a platform company can truly exist over time is by being willing to put it&rsquo;s current platforms at risk of extinction through the creation of more viable future platforms. In my opinion some people in Google know this and that appears to be the reason why they are <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/google-fuchsia">quiently working on Fuchsia</a> but only time will tell whether this insight is fully embraced by those who are running the company.</p>

         	<p>Last year <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/it-strikes-me/">I wrote</a> about Apple&rsquo;s plans to enable iOS apps to run on MacOS, comparing it to what Google has done for Android on Chrome OS. Today I can officially run Android apps on Chrome OS, but not yet iOS on Mac. An interesting subplot added during <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/wwdc-2019">WWDC this year</a> is iPadOS, which is clearly an acknowledgement that there are UI elements more appropriate for tablets than phones.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/05/29/for-a-president.html">For A President, Congress Is The Law</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2019/05/29/for-a-president.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-29 19:59:24 -0500">May 29, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I wonder, if the Republicans controlled the House, whether there would already be an impreachment inquiry open. Mueller served the role as investigator, collecting evidence and documenting his findings. The Constitution gives the House the job of prosecuting attorney (not the Attorney General) in determining whether to charge the President with a crime, which for the President has the unique label of impreachment.</p>

<p>A Republican inquiry would review the evidence, formally declare there is none to bring charges, and then the case is closed. Until the House says it is closed, the case is not closed no matter what Trump or Barr says. That is the Constitution.</p>

<p>To uphold their oath to the Constitution, Democrats in the House must open the impeachment inquiry and determine whether or not to vote articles of impeachment. They must be willing to take the political risk, if that exists, to fulfill their role in our government. It’s not about politics, it’s about the rule of law.</p>

<p>In fact, I think Congress should produce new presidential special consule legislation that states that all presidential special consule investigations require an impeachment inquiry to formalize the conclusions of the investigation.</p>

<p>If the criminal justice system cannot bring charges against a sitting president then Congress has to take serious this responsibility. That is unless Congress thinks the President really is above the law.</p>

<p>Mueller did the same thing as the Watergate investigation, he laid out the case for Congress to draw a conclusion on impeachment. In short, his entire effort was to layout the evidence for an impeachment inquiry to draw a conclusion, which exactly what the Constitution intends. If the House does not open an inquiry then it is discrediting Mueller&rsquo;s work and not upholding their own oath to the Constitution. In the end, they might not draft articles of impeachment, but they absolutely should open the inquiry.</p>

<p>Props to Amash for having the integrity to put his oath over party loyalty.</p>

         	<p>The <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/crostini">Crostini</a> Linux containers on my Google Pixelbook melted down after I upgraded the Pixelbook to the stable release of Chrome OS 74, a reminder that Linux Apps (Crostini) is very much in beta.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve written <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/crostini-failure-after-chrome-os-74-upgrade">the details</a> of what occurred, the trigger seems to be that I had two containers. After Chrome OS 74 installs and you launch a container, such as by starting the Terminal app, you see a message telling you that the Linux apps is being upgraded and the app you wish to run will load after the upgrade completes.</p>

<p>I saw the message for the primary container, named penguin, and everything worked as planned. The meltdown began when I started Gnome Terminal, which was in the second container, the one in which I was running Docker. The upgrade message appeared but the upgrade did not seem to complete. After letting it run for an hour, which was much longer than the prior upgrade, I restarted the Pixelbook, and either that or the upgrade rendered the container usable.</p>

<p>From here a few attempts to fix the problem cascaded the meltdown to primary container too. My attempts to re-build and restore the primary container from a backup failed and I am left to re-building from scratch. Not totally awful given that I had no real data in either container, just apps with a bit of data synced to a cloud or github.</p>

<p>I am not entirely sure what happened. I might have been too impatient and the second container may have upgraded had I just let it run. Or, it might be that running Docker in the second container created problems.</p>

<p>The moral of this blog post is that even if you are sticking to the Chrome OS stable channel, Linux Apps (Crostini) is still in beta and thus breakage can and will occur.</p>

         	<p>Today is Day 1 of Google I/O 2019 and I managed to watch most of the opening keynote via live stream. I&rsquo;ve created <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/google-io-2019">a wiki page</a> to capture information from the conference this year. The biggest news from the keynote were hardware related.</p>

<p>One is the consolidation of Google Home and Nest, the Nest brand remains. With this consolidation is a new video hub, the Nest Hub Max.</p>

<p>The other big news was the announcement of two new, power priced phones, the Pixel 3a and 3a XL. While not unexpected, still interesting timing given that Google announced the Pixel 3/3XL last October.</p>

<p>The setup process for moving from one iPad to another is pretty neat. It automatically detects the old nearby iPad and establishes a connection to it by scanning a barcode with the camera.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been having fun breaking and fixing my wiki over the last several days, and in the process learned more about wiki. Wiki is written in nodejs and there is a wiki-server and a wiki-client along with several plugins. My adventures began when an update was made to wiki-client that broke the ability to use HTML forms in a wiki page. A fix was made to wiki-client that resolved the problem but my server was not getting the update.</p>

<p>It appears that somewhere along the line I managed to install wiki in two different directories on my server. The install from which I was running wiki was not updating when I ran npm install -g wiki and it took me a while to figure out how to <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/run-wiki-from-global-installation">run the global install instance of wiki</a> that I was updating.</p>

<p>Today I removed the &ldquo;second&rdquo; installation but now I have to provide the full path to the correct, current, installation of wiki. When I just run wiki it tries to run it from a directory in which it is no longer located. I must have an alias or script pointing it in that direction but for now I haven&rsquo;t figured it out.</p>

<p>Anyway, I now have the current verison of wiki-client so I can now fill in html forms, one of which is for a search plugin that now appears to be broken. Oy vey! Search works on a older installation on my Pixelbook, but the new version/current version is not working.</p>

<p>At least I did manage to get the graphviz plugin installed (you can see it in action <a href="https://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/preview-next-diagram">on this page</a>), figuring out how to set up myself as an admin user to do the installation took time to suss out.</p>

<p>Breaking and fixing things is a important part of the learning process when learning software.</p>

         	<p>At 2:30 PM I got a notification that Tiger Woods won the Masters, which was a surprise because the final pair usually doesn’t tee off until late in the afternoon. I did not know they decided to start five hours early due to the weather forecast. At least I did get to see the rebroadcast of Tiger’s last nine holes. Seeing his son greet him off the 18th hole was special.</p>

<p>Drug companies are able to pay PBMs — as well as hospitals and some doctors — to make sure cheaper drugs are left out. It’s as simple as that. Drug companies pay everyone along the way so that lower-price drugs lose.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have competition when the system is gamed, and those who argue against &ldquo;single payer&rdquo; health insurance always hinge their argument on competition. If you don&rsquo;t want to change health insurance then do something about the costs with regulation that forces competition.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have been reading Dave Winer&rsquo;s writing for a long time, and a common theme of his writing is journalism. My translation of what he has been saying is that news has become a platform, and as such anyone can do it, and those who are employed as journalists need to shift from being gatekeepers to being participants. True platforms route around gatekeepers.</p>

<p>The reason why this message is not well received by journalists is obvious, it&rsquo;s because <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/04/02/132922.html">what they hear is that you no longer have a job</a>. Staying employed is important to these people and you cannot blame them because it is how they support their families.</p>

<p>When the constitution was written people like Benjamin Franklin viewed journalism as a vocation because frankly the idea of a &ldquo;job&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t really exist. When vocations became professions, a shift in priorities took place, with maintaining employment moving to the top. When journalism transformed to media thanks to corporate consolidation, the move to journalism being about money became complete.</p>

<p>The honest question that has been avoided ever since is, is what we have, journalism as media to make profits, consistent with the &ldquo;fourth estate&rdquo; established by the First Amendment? If the prime objective of the Consitution, of which the First Amendment is a part, is to be the United in the United States of America, then today&rsquo;s media is not that which the first amendment refers to because there is more profits generated from disunity than unity.</p>

<p>Citizens instinctively know that the profits that corporate ownership demands is corupting, and therefore they do not trust media because they know there is a bias towards making money over telling truth.</p>

<p>Of course Fox News is giving their viewers what they want to hear, that is how they make money! Of course MSNBC is giving their viewers what they want to hear, that is how they make money! Of course the New York Times is giving their readers what they want to red, that is how they make money!</p>

<p>On and on it goes. It is another example of how hyper capitalism is destroying republican democracy and thus destroying our country.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>In December micro.blog stopped exporting my site to Github, a consequence of their change from jekyll to hugo as the CMS. We do have manual ways to export a site, one is to download an export file as a Wordpress export and the other is to generate an archive in a &ldquo;blog archive format&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be well documented. Manton wrote <a href="https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html">a post</a> proposing the format in 2017, but I have not found anything else so it doesn&rsquo;t appear that format is useful to anyone other than programmers.</p>

<p>An export is only as good as the ability to import, so I decided to create a local install of <a href="https://medium.com/@tatemz/local-wordpress-development-with-docker-3-easy-steps-a7c375366b9">Wordpress on my Pixelbook using Docker</a> and then try importing the Wordpress export. The good news is that the import was successful. <del>The bad news is that the export file retains markdown that is not converted to HTML so none of the links in the posts appear correctly. We either need the micro.blog export process to convert to HTML or some way for the import process to convert markdown to HTML.</del></p>

<p>Update: I was directed to install the JP Markdown plug in to my site, which I did and then did a wipe and re-import and the good news is that with it installed all the markdown formating is appearing on the local Wordpress site.</p>

         	<p>Oddly, one of the challenging things about wiki is creating new pages.

<p>The problem is, those new links can accumulate over time and then I have to back and remove them. I have found code for an HTML form to create a new page so that I can enter a page title, click create, and a new ghost page appears.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/25/tech/apple-credit-card/index.html">The Apple Card</a> looks to me to be very much the same as the card that Google tried a few years ago. Granted, Apple&rsquo;s is a Credit Card while Google&rsquo;s was only a debit card, but the hurdles are similar. How do you get people to switch and why should they if they can use their existing credit card with Apple Pay?  I get the desire to make money on transactions, that is a repeat of the Apple Store model that makes Apple a lot of money. However, in this instance I don&rsquo;t see why I or anyone would switch.</p>

         	<p>Our current state can be traced to the early 90s, which happens to coincide with thinking originating at the Harvard Business School that CEO compensation should be tied to stock performance. The idea is that the best way to increase shareholder return is to create incentives tied to that return. Unfortunately, the idea is <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1db3jy3201d38/The-MBA-Myth-and-the-Cult-of-the-CEO">a theory that is proving to be false</a>.</p>

However, it seems to me one thing we don&rsquo;t consider is that what might be the best way to address the problem is to enable people to have a good life where they currently live.  People who are well off in South America don&rsquo;t take the risk of traveling thousands of miles to the United States, desperate people take that risk. Building a wall is not going to stop people from taking that risk. A wall is a band aid, not a solution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Commerce Department said this week that despite two years of America First-ism, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit is getting worse rather than better.After all the fuss about the tax cuts, it turns out that corporations benefited, not workers. And while joblessness is  at an all-time low, the economy turns out to be churning out many more jobs at the bottom end of the skills market than middle-class jobs. Wages still lag, city centers are still rotting, infrastructure projects are still crumbling, public housing is still in trouble.  Oh and then there is this massive debt resulting from unpaid for tax cuts.  At the border, the Trump protectionist approach appears to be not working, as the monthly immigration numbers attest.</p>

<p>Actually, some will say that Trump&rsquo;s election is a shake up of the two party system. He is certainly not a conservative Republican it is arguable whether he is a Republican at all.</p>

<p>The problem with Congress is that it has become nothing more than an extension of the President&rsquo;s &ldquo;team.&rdquo; Congress doesn&rsquo;t exist as a separate entity and therefore does not fulfill is role as the second branch of government, and that is bad because Congress&rsquo; role is fundamental to the republican form of democracy created by the Constitution.</p>

<p>To desire to keep down the rate of wages, with the view of favoring the exportation of merchandise, is to seek to render the citizens of a state miserable, in order that foreigners may purchase its productions at a cheaper rate; it is, at most, attempting to enrich a few merchants by impoverishing the body of the nation; it is taking the part of the stronger in that contest, already so unequal, between the man who can pay wages, and him who is under the necessity of receiving them; it is, in one word, to forget, that the object of every political society ought to be the happiness of the largest number.</p>

<p>Insurance is really about probabilities and statistics, and insurance companies are essentially gambling on the premise that there is a lower probability of paying out money than taking in money.</p>

<p>Car insurance is real, one might go a life time without ever having to file a claim yet must pay for it regardless if you own a car. (BTW, in most states one MUST buy at least liability insurance.)</p>

<p>If car insurance were like health insurance one would be filing a claim every time they took their car in for an oil change or some other repair.</p>

<p>With the frequency of payouts, the real question is, why would any private corporation want to even be in the health insurance business? The only way it can be profitable to a corporation is to take in more money by charging more than they pay out. Can you not seen the fundamental problem here?</p>

         	<p>My number one tip for anyone planning to work from home is go invest in a good chair. You want something that is ergonomic and can withstand a lot of use, so you are best to go with real office furniture. We bought two <a href="https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/leap/">Steelcase Leap</a> chairs about six years ago and they look new and remain as comfortable as the first day they arrived.

<blockquote>
<p>At the close of the Cold War, some commentators concluded that the American experiment had ended in triumph, that the United States had become all the world. But the American experiment had not in fact ended. A nation founded on revolution and universal rights will forever struggle against chaos and the forces of particularism. A nation born in contradiction will forever fight over the meaning of its history.</p>

<p>The first time you launch the Terminal app the virtual machine (termina) and default container (penguin) start, which accounts for the longer than perhaps expected time to launch.</p>

<p>The United States is in a state of emergency: 28 national ones and many more local. This might come as a surprise, but it isn’t new—this month marks the start of our 39th year in a continuous emergency state. What is an emergency, and how did we get here? This post explains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1976 National Emergencies Act requires Congress to meet every six months to end the state of emergency. If you want to know why Democracy is failing in the United States, read no further than the following&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not once has Congress met to consider such a vote. It is not exactly clear why. But the provision would have lost much of its intended force even had Congress complied: It originally allowed Congress to end an emergency by concurrent resolution (that is, if majorities in both houses voted to end it). But in 1983, the Supreme Court declared this sort of legislative veto over presidential action unconstitutional. A 1985 amendment to the act now requires a joint resolution to end the emergency, meaning that any Congressional vote to end the emergency is subject to the president’s veto, which may be overridden only by two-thirds majorities of both houses.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve had the same reaction to Howard Schultz&rsquo;s comment about the American Dream <a href="http://scripting.com/2019/01/31/213234.html">as Dave</a>. When I was growing up the American Dream was equated to the Middle Class, by which I mean adults aspired to having a comfortable life and dreamt of a better life for their children.</p>

<p>While I do agree with Schultz in that another way to describe the American Dream is to be successful, I think the biggest problem is measuring success by wealth. The focus on wealth in America is allowing us to accept the huge income inequality that exists in our country.</p>

<p>For me, Schultz implying that Elizabeth Warren and others want to punish him and others for being successful is totally wrong. What we want is for the very wealthy people to contribute a share to society commensurate with their ability.</p>

<p>Schultz might want to put on an indepedent label, but his ideology is conservative Republican selling himself as a Democrat Ross Perot.</p>

         	<p>It should be clear by now that the only way out of the government shutdown standoff is for the Senate to override the President&rsquo;s veto, if one comes. If Republican Senators have the courage to live their oath and serve all citizens of the United States, they can easily gain bi-partisan support to override the President and THAT is how our government is intended to work!</p>

<p>When did we forget that the United States is not governed by a king?</p>

         	<p><a href="https://politicalwire.com/2019/01/24/gop-senators-getting-nervous/">Dear Republican Senators</a>. You should be nervous, and the U.S. Constitution gives you the power to open the government, you simply override the President&rsquo;s veto. You serve the citizens of the United States, you do not serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States. Your job is not to just enable what the President wants, your job is to write laws that govern our country. Do your job. A good first step is to pass and override any veto to the appropriations laws to open the government. The next step is to replace Mitch McConnell as your Senate leader.</p>

<p>Simply serving at the pleasure of your party&rsquo;s President is in practice nothing more than a monarchy/authoritarian rule. If you truly believe in democracy, if you are to uphold your oath to the Constitution, you will exert your authority as the co-equal branch of government who has as one of its primary purposes oversight of the executive branch of government.</p>

<p>Do your job. The Republic depends on you, otherwise we slip in to the same tyranny from which we revoluted against and it will be under your watch and will be your legacy.</p>

         	<p>The real problem with the zeal in declaring anything <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-edge-mobile-fake-news/">fake news</a> is the question of who decides what is real news? The problem isn&rsquo;t whether or not something is fake, the real problem is how is something decided to be real.</p>

<p>When Trump says someone&rsquo;s reporting is fake, what is really saying is that if he isn&rsquo;t the one telling you then it is fake.</p>

&gt;The exorbitant prices confound patients and doctors alike since insulin is nearly a century old now. The pricing is all the more infuriating when one considers that the discoverers of insulin sold the patent for $1 each to ensure that the medication would be affordable. Today the three main manufacturers of insulin are facing a lawsuit accusing them of deceptive pricing schemes, but it could be years before this yields any changes.</p>

<p>Again, to fix health care you have to address the pricing and the fact that ever component of health care is gaming the system.</p>

         	<p>So, Mitch McConnell is the literally the person causing the shutdown because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2018%E2%80%932019">as the Republican Senate majority leader</a> he refuses to take up the appropriations bills passed by the House of Representatives. Blame Mitch not Trump.</p>

<p>If you recall from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otbml6WIQPo">How A Bill Becomes A Law</a>, Congress has the ability to override the President&rsquo;s veto. So, if the Senate passed the bills passed by the House, they go to the President, and if he vetos then is back in Congress&rsquo; power to override the bills in which they become law.</p>

<p>So once again, Congress has within its power given to it by the Constitution to govern and like so many times in the past Mitch McConnell is not living up to his oath.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to start putting pressure on the Republicans and McConnell.</p>

         	<p>The real problem with social networks like Facebook and Twitter is that they require using their servers that store all of what you write and share. By nature of the fact that you are using their servers Facebook and Twitter have the right and ability to access what you write and share.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2588287/networking/networking-peer-to-peer-network.html">peer to peer network</a> takes a server, like Facebook and Twitter&rsquo;s, out of the middle. What you write and share goes directly from your computer to the computer of others on the peer to peer network. Because this information can actually end up on many more computers most peer to peer networks encrypt what is passed around. Consequently, only the people who have access to your public or private keys can actually read what you write. (By the way, in a simple way I have just explained one reason why <a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/">blockchain</a> has been written so much about.)</p>

         	<p>I am intrigued by the number of alternative social network products being developed. Some consider <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, which I have been using, as one. I think of Micro.blog as a hybrid decentralized environment, but which I mean you can use it to either store content on their server, like I do, or use it to facilitate content you store an other site.  I store what I write on <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my blog</a> and transmit copies of that to Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<p>However, I suspect that if it becomes dead simple, reliable, and secure, a peer-to-peer type of network like <a href="https://infourminutes.co/whitepaper/scuttlebutt">Secure Scuttlebutt</a> will be the winner.</p>

<p>What is also important to understand is that what has been going here is emotional manipulation, that is what advertising is all about. Generations of Americans, starting with the Baby Boomers, have been programmed with emotional manipulation, which is why now, seemingly all of a sudden, &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; is such a thing. The Internet is an echo chamber of emotional manipulation, which is why the social network hacking has been so effective.</p>

The thing is that the Constitution provides the power of the line-item veto to Congress through its ability to write and pass legislation.

Without that confrontation with an infection, the system is left unprimed and will not work properly.”</p>

         	<p>Another holiday vacation has come to an end. I did not cross off all the items on my to-do list, but that is a bit of the point. Instead were spontaneous movies and trips to Starbucks. I did finish reading two books and start and finish a third. We had great weather, although warmer than usual for this time of the year, and no snow. Right now we don’t know when is the next possibility for significant snow fall. In the end, it has been a good time and now I am ready for 2019. I wonder what is in store?</p>

<p>This book is a proposal to rethink religion so that our definitions are both more accurate and more inclusive of the variety of religious experience around the world. It also is an argument that there is a way to be religious and modern, open minded, progressive, appreciative of science, tolerant, and a peaceful global citizen of the 21st century.</p>

<p>As we in news and media attack the platforms and their every misstep — and there are many — we need to turn the mirror on ourselves. It was news media that polarized the nation into camps of red v. blue, white v. black, 1 percent v. 99 percent long before Facebook was born. It was our business model in media that favored confrontation over resolution. It was our business model in advertising that valued volume, attention, page views, and eyeballs — the business model that then corrupted the internet. It was our failure to inform the public that enabled people to vote against their self-interest for Trump or Brexit.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Made my third trip to the eye glasses place to get my new glasses adjusted and confirm that the prescription is right and the measurements are right. I have a pretty significant stigmatism and the introduction of progressives has complicated the process of getting new lenses. Every pair I have had since progressives has required multiple trips to get the fit right, and one time the lenses had to be remade.</p>

<p>Today I got the manager/customer advocate take care of me. The first lesson learned is that for my prescription, experience matters. The customer advocate confirmed the measurements are correct and he did adjust the frame so that the glasses now feel better and sit better on my face.</p>

<p>I learned that my progressive prescription changed pretty significantly for my right eye, so that means I would definitely have a noticable difference and need more time to adjust. Most importantly, he told me that due to the change I need to hold what I am reading closer to force my eyes to read through the progressives. Holding a book where I had in the past put it at the mid-way point, which causes strain. Nobody told me this, I don&rsquo;t know how I was supposed to know.</p>

<p>So, now I know I have to change what I do and I have to give my eyes/brain time to adjust. These simple but important pieces of information should have been given to me either at the first appointment or when I first picked up the glasses. My theory about this customer experience is that the experience of the people taking care of you matters. They probably don&rsquo;t see my particular prescription often, and then 20 somethings doing the work simply don&rsquo;t have the experience to handle my prescription.</p>

Blot is not the first blogging platform that uses Dropbox as the content store, the first that I am familiar with was <a href="http://fargo.io/">Fargo</a>. The difference is that Fargo included a UI as well as a publisher where as Blot just has a publisher and the UI is one&rsquo;s preferred text editor and the Dropbox UI.</p>

         	<p>I still wish I could batch all of my blog posts for a day into one titled batch, with the title being that day&rsquo;s date. Perhaps I am being too picky, but when I scroll down my blog the dates above each post don&rsquo;t look good. Titled posts aren&rsquo;t much better. I could manually make it appear the way I want, but that is too much friction. I guess what I am saying is that I miss <a href="http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net/">my old blogging format</a>.</p>

         	<p>I got an idea. If you look at the Discuss link on <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/12/21/if-there-were.html">this post</a>, you see that it points back to the discussion thread on micro.blog. What if when you tapped that link on iOS it launched the micro.blog app? Right now it just opens the thread in a web page. On Windows if you are logged in to micro.blog you can actually reply and participate in the discussion.</p>

<p>You see, I think of micro.blog as a blogging platform and not as a Twitter alternative so I envision the blog is a starting point and not the micro.blog timeline. If one starts on the blog and I want follow up discussion, I should be able to make it happy. Adding a link like I did is easy enough.</p>

         	<p>The iPad and <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> is evolving into my preferred blogging platform due to a shortcut I created that quotes text from web pages in the exact format that I prefer. I use Omnibear in Chrome on my notebook computers but doesn&rsquo;t automatically grab the web page title, address, and selected text like the shortcut. I think I used to have a bookmarklet that did the job back during my earlier blogging days.</p>

<p>Oh, and the fact that Drafts makes it easier to link to pages doesn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>

<p>The problem is, I don&rsquo;t only use my iPad, so when I am reading on another computer it is a bit disruptive to have to switch computers to write a blog post.</p>

         	<p>For a company that is data driven, I am surprised by how little information <a href="https://wellbeing.google/">Google&rsquo;s Digital Wellbeing app</a> provides. For example, it doesn&rsquo;t tell me my average screen on time nor does it tell me whether my use is trending up or down. Trends are key to making decisions and Digital Wellbeing provides none, therefore I don&rsquo;t understand what decisions I should conclude from the data it does provide.</p>

         	<p>Progress cannot happen amongst people who are unwilling to accept they could be wrong. The scientific method is based on the truth that ideas, hypothesis, can be wrong and hence requires proof of  hypothesis that is peer reviewed and consensed as being right or most likely right. Proofs are not only facts but also consensed arguments of what is most likely right. Built in to science is acceptance that what may be considered a proven correct hypothesis today could be proven incorrect hypothesis tomorrow and that is considered to be progress.</p>

         	<p>I think that unregulated capitalism is really survival of the fittest applied to wealth. Left unchecked, as it mostly is today, pure capitalism leads to monopolies that destroy any real free market.</p>

<p>I am encouraged by <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-introduces-accountable-capitalism-act">Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s Accountable Capitalism Act</a> even if I am skeptical it will result in real legislation. This topic needs to be addressed because of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But in the 1980s a new idea quickly took hold: American corporations should focus only on maximizing returns to their shareholders. That had a seismic impact on the American economy. In the early 1980s, America&rsquo;s biggest companies dedicated less than half of their profits to shareholders and reinvested the rest in the company. But over the last decade, big American companies have dedicated 93% of earnings to shareholders - redirecting trillions of dollars that could have gone to workers or long-term investments. The result is that booming corporate profits and rising worker productivity have not led to rising wages.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Smith, 61, retired after the 1997 season with more saves than any player before him. His saves still rank third all-time behind Mariano Rivera and Trevor Hoffman. A seven-time All-Star and three-time Rolaids Relief Man Award winner, Smith led his league in saves four times, including a career-best 47 in 1991, and had 30-plus saves in 10 of his 18 seasons with the Cubs, Red Sox, Cardinals, Yankees, Orioles, Angels, Reds and Expos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lee Smith more or less ascended to the closer role after Bruce Sutter went to the Cardinals, and was the Cubs closer through my high school years. He was a classic power pitcher who occasionally would grove a fastball for a home run. Sutter is in the Hall of Fame and I think it&rsquo;s right that Smith joins him.</p>

         	<p>A REPLY TO RICHARD ROHR ON THE COSMIC CHRIST – Omega Center
Ilia Delio,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Christ is the communion of divine personal love expressed in every created form of reality—every star, leaf, bird, fish, tree, rabbit and every human person. Everything is christified because everything expresses divine love incarnate.  However, Jesus Christ is the “thisness” of God (‘God is like this and this is God’) so what Jesus is by nature everything else is by grace (divine love).   We are not God but every single person is born out of the love of God, expresses this love in his/her unique personal form and has the capacity to be united with God.  It is for this reason that the Franciscan theologian Bonaventure described the mystery of Jesus Christ as a coincidence of opposites.  Because Jesus _is _the Christ, every human is already reconciled with every other human in the mystery of divine so that Christ is more than Jesus alone; Christ is the whole reality bound in a union of love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we say, “Jesus is the Christ,” we are saying that the humanity of Jesus is one with divinity, the “mystery hidden from the beginning of the world.”   There is a particularity here, a <em>haecceitas</em> (or thisness) that cannot be overlooked.   Jesus _is _the Christ which means all that God is, is given to us in Jesus, rendering a new understanding of God as relational, self-communicative, self-emptying.</p>

         	<p>I recently built <a href="http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net">my own Federated Wiki server</a> and have been having a lot fun adding content to it since. I&rsquo;ve found that for me it is the best way to maintain a &ldquo;Now&rdquo; page of things I am currently working on or researching.</p>

<p>As a topic comes up, I got to <a href="http://fedwiki.frankmcpherson.net/view/welcome-visitors/view/now">the Now page</a> and create a wiki link to the topic, which I then click to create a new page to which I start adding content.</p>

<p>What I need to determine is what to do with the topics that I complete. I think the ideal solution is a plugin that automatically generates an index of all pages in my wiki so that even when I remove the wiki link in the Now page, a link to the page remains somewhere so that it can be found later. I could manually build an index, but in this day and age I would think an automated approach would be possible and best.</p>

<p><em>Update: Alas, turning off Mobile Battery Saver wasn&rsquo;t the fix, the problem reoccurred. Next step is to turn off the always on display. I&rsquo;ve also sent a message to Fossil to see if they can tell me how to downgrade.</em></p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/11/30/a-few-weeks.html">Planting A Garden</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/11/30/a-few-weeks.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-30 18:37:46 -0500">Nov 30, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A few weeks ago I read <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</a> by Mike Caulfield and it really resonated with me. In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden.</p>

<p>One thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked. My affinity toward structure is also why I find outlines appealing.</p>

<p>Chronology (reverse), archives, and permalinks are structures of blogs that I think distinguish it technologically from &ldquo;regular&rdquo; web sites. The informal personal voice of blogs is what distinguishes the blog writing style from other writing styles you see on the web.</p>

<p>And yet, blogs writing is also point in time. One writes a blog post, it enters the stream, and beyond perhaps that first day one rarely, if ever, edits or adds to a blog post.</p>

<p>The ongoing revision of a piece of writing is fundamentally what I think Caulfield means by &ldquo;the garden.&rdquo; With that paradigm, I created two &ldquo;projects&rdquo;, the first being a web page in which I originally wrote about <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html">which Chromebook I was going to buy</a> and then continually revised that page as I learned more up until I made my decision. The second project is a new page in which I am recording <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/11/25/google-pixelbook.html">my experience with using the Pixelbook</a>.</p>

<p>In both instances I created and maintained those pages using jekyll and offline tools like Drafts and Typora, which I find works very well. However, it feels that a wiki is more in tune with the garden concept which is why <a href="http://testing.frankmcpherson.net">I have been dabbling with wikis</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, this whole thing is work in progress. I think I favor the offline ability I have with my jekyll and Netlify set up versus in browser editing required by DokuWiki.</p>

<p>Wear OS Update H installed on my watch two days ago. There appears to be a problem recovering from the new &ldquo;deep sleep&rdquo; / suspend mode. At intermittent times the watch appears to be unresponsive, basically it looks as though it is frozen after I attempt to wake it by either moving my arm, tapping the screen or pressing the crown. Eventually it does come back/recover, which leads me to suspect the watch has gone in to suspend/deep sleep and takes a long time to resume. I appreciate the idea of saving battery life by going into such a state, but the watch needs to recover much faster as right now it is a horrible user experience. Is anyone else seeing this? Is this a known problem with a fix in progress, or is there a way to disable this &ldquo;feature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started to notice this behavior yesterday. I&rsquo;ve restarted the watch in hopes that might resolve. My fear is that this is a processor issue causing this watch to not be able to resume from this form of suspend fast enough.</p>

<p>When I started college in 1984 Fortran was the language taught in the introductory programming class required by computer science and engineering students. Advanced computer science classes used Pascal. Java did not exist then.</p>

<p>I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>At some point soon we may all need to decide what is more important, preserving, protecting, and defending the Constitution of the United States or keeping our party in office.</p>

<p>As citizens of the United States this is our oath too, not just the oath of those whom we elect.</p>

         	<p>News about <a href="https://chromeunboxed.com/grab-a-pixelbook-for-699-on-black-friday-and-score-3-months-of-youtube-tv/">the Black Friday sale on the Google Pixelbook</a> has me reconsidering <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html">my plan</a> to buy a new Chromebook.</p>

<p>While the Lenovo and HP Chromebooks that I have been looking at have an 8th generation Intel processor, the Pixelbook is an overall better machine and I imagine its 7th generation Intel processor will server me equally well.  On the other hand, that U processor in the Lenovo is definitely better performing that the Y processor, which Apple choose for the new Macbook Air.</p>

<p>I had not considered the Pixelbook due to normal $999 price. The sale price is in line with the version of the Lenovo C630 I am considering. Food for thought, does anyone have advice on which one to go with?</p>

Chrome OS, first released in 2011, is the newest I&rsquo;ve used, and even that can be debated because it uses a Linux Kernel.</p>

<p>According to my past weblog posts, <a href="https://fjmnotes.com/2009/01/10/giving-palm-its-just-due/">WebOS may be the newest</a> prior to Chrome OS. Android and iOS already existed for a few years.</p>

<p>Would there even be a debate about whether an iPad can be one&rsquo;s only computer if touchscreens were invented before the mouse? IMHO the major impediment is iOS&rsquo; lack of support for Bluetooth mice.</p>

<p>I think if Apple wanted to, they could take a cue from Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/">Project Crostini</a> to add containerized desktop app support to iOS. The Pros would be smart enough to handle containers, while the normal users would probably not want nor need it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve long mused that what we really need are devices that have built-in hypervisors upon which one could run any operating environment they wished. Containers come close to this idea.</p>

         	<p>If you did not vote in 2016 and were shocked that Trump won, please know that one very big reason why he did win is because people did not vote. Not voting tomorrow is a vote in support of a Republican controlled government and we know that Republicans cannot govern. If you want change, it starts tomorrow with your vote.</p>

         	<p>The pricing and models for the Lenovo Yoga C630 are confusing. Let&rsquo;s start with Lenovo direct, <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/perksoffer/laptops/yoga/yoga-c-series/Yoga-Chromebook-C630/p/88YGCC61096?menu-id=Yoga_Chromebook_C630">they list two models</a> one with a I3 processor, backlit keyboard and 64 GB of storage for $599, the other with the I5 and 128 GB of storage with backlit keyboard for $719. If you want a C630 with a backlit keyboard you can only buy one from Lenovo&rsquo;s web site.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-flash-memory-midnight-blue/6295998.p?skuId=6295998">Best Buy has a version of the C630</a> with an I5 128 GB of storage and no backlit keyboard for $649. Best Buy also has <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-2-in-1-14-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-64gb-emmc-flash-memory-hp-finish-in-ceramic-white-and-cloud-blue/6301869.p?skuId=6301869">the HP X360 X14 for $549</a>.</p>

<p>The low end Lenovo C630 that you can buy from their web site appears to compete head on with the HP X360 X14.</p>

The C630s being sold by Best Buy do not have a backlit keyboard while the ones sold directly by Lenovo do, according to a Lenovo rep. Apparently the want to entice people to buy direct.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve been traveling over the past week, visiting family and friends throughout Michigan and Wisconsin. This morning I am packing up to depart on the next leg of my trip and struck by how few bags I have on this trip.</p>

<p>Ten years ago when I made this trip I packed one or two plastic bins for power cords, surge protectors, WiFi access points and more. I may have had a few bags for computers and then my regular luggage.</p>

<p>Now, all of my electronics that includes one notebook computer, two tablets, and their associated cords all fit in to one backpack. I have on suitecase and that is it. Obviously, the electronics that I carry is much smaller than ten years ago, but I am also helped by updated hotels with plenty of power outlets and WiFi. No more hunting around and moving furniture to find an available outlet.</p>

         	<p>I am trying out <a href="https://www.trunknotes.com/">TrunkNotes</a>, which I learned about here on micro.blog. TrunkNotes is a personal wiki very similar to <a href="https://www.voodoopad.com/">VoodooPad</a>. <del>One thing I am trying to recall about VoodooPad is whether it automatically creates links to new pages for wiki words, I thought it did while TrunkNotes does not. TrunkNotes will create a link to a page if one associated to the wiki word already exists and I find that more limiting than if the app automatically created links whether the page already existed or not. The current method requires going back to edit pages to add links to other pages.</del></p>

<p>Found out that I did not create a valid wiki word, which is why TrunkNotes did not auotmatically create a link for a new page. It turns out TrunkNotes works exactly as I want it to.</p>

<p>I am planning to by a new Chromebook this year, and I am working on an article that describes which ones I am considering and why. As I was writing that article to occurred to me a more fundamental question I needed to answer is why am I even considering Chrome OS?

<p>I think blog posts are a form of writing that is under appreciated. First, few people remember that blog is actually a shortcut for weblog, literally a log of the web. Most log entries are short descriptions.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t write this to criticize, there is no right or wrong, instead I want to point out that a blog has always meant to be simple and true to one&rsquo;s voice. You don&rsquo;t have to write volumes nor have a witty title. Just link to something on the web and perhaps explain why you think it worth sharing. For that matter the blog can simply be for yourself.</p>

         	<p>My Notes From The Apple Event</p>

<p>Tim Cook was max PT Barnum at the Apple Event, which I find annoying after listening for 20 minutes. At this point they can just move on to the announcements, the forced excitement and employee enthused applause is becoming old.</p>

<p>The $1200 price for the new MacBook Air is pretty much what I expected. Given how the MacBook has been redesigned, I am not sure why one would not just get a MacBook rather than an Air.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Mac Mini got a nice spec upgrade retaining the $800 price, which is cheap for a Mac but not so much relative to other desktops. I guess if you want a low cost Mac, the Mini is the one to get, as always.</p>

<p>The new iPad Pros were the star of the event, and they have me wishing I did not buy my iPad last year. For me the slightly larger screen and CPU upgrades are very appealing.</p>

<p>Can the new Pencil work with older iPad Pros? I need to learn more about the Pencil, and if it works with old Pros I may buy one. Can 2 Pencils connect to an iPad at the same time?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A human being,” wrote Einstein in reply, “is a part of the whole, called by us “Universe,’ a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a founda tion for inner security.”</p>

&gt;It is beyond comprehension, the degree to which the Democratic party nationally has essentially abdicated half of the states in this country to rightwing Republicans, including some of the poorest states in America, those in the south,” Sanders said. “The reason I go to Kansas and many so-called red states is that I will do everything that I can to bring new people into the political process in states which are today conservative. I do not know how you turn those states around unless you go there and get people excited</p>

<p>You also can&rsquo;t assume you have a state won. I believe the 2016 Presidential election would have a different outcome had Hilary actively campaigned in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

         	<p>Back in the day before Gmail I used to run my own email server in my house. It was a bit of a pain to maintain, but it satisfied the geek in me. There is a company that is selling <a href="https://thehelm.com/pages/product">an IoT-like email server</a> that costs $500. I&rsquo;ve never heard of the company and therefore can&rsquo;t vouch for it, but I find the appliance intriguing. Just found <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/10/meet-helm-the-startup-taking-on-gmail-with-a-server-that-runs-in-your-home/">an article on Ars Technica</a> about this product.</p>

<p>The solution, called Helm, sounds a lot like <a href="https://twitter.com/pogoplug?lang=en">Pogoplug</a>, which was a personal cloud storage device that is no longer available. The risk of using a product from a small company that might not stay in business to store and access personal data is something one has to take in to consideration.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I looked for the oldest message in my Gmail archive, its from when I first got an account in May, 2004.</p>

&gt;Television producers booked one right-wing religious figure after another, all taking the side of Terri Schiavo’s parents, as if “religion” spoke with one voice on this issue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many assume that how they see Christianity represented by talking heads on TV defines Christianity. One of the biggest mistakes made about religion is thinking that there is one voice on Christian thought, which is why government decisions based on Christian ethics conflicts with the first amendment.</p>

Frankly, I had the same complaints about how the Packer&rsquo;s treated the second half of Brett Farve&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>You have one of the best, if not the best, quarterbacks in the league, but you do not keep him surrounded by good talent. Good receivers, running backs, offensive line, or defense. You put in place a coach who frankly doesn&rsquo;t appear to have a sense of urgency.</p>

<p>The Packers were very fortunate to have drafted Aaron and that he was better than they most likely thought when he was drafted. Most teams do not replace one hall of fame quarterback with another hall of fame quarterback. It is not likely they will do the same when it comes time for Aaron to step down, and that means that every season that Aaron plays in which you don&rsquo;t win a Super Bowl could be another year added to many, many years of not winning one.</p>

         	<p>How much screen time is too much screen time? Looking at the <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/pie-9-0/digital-wellbeing-beta/">Digital Wellbeing Android app</a>, there were only two days last weekn when my Pixel 2 screen was on for more than an hour. Only three times last week I uinlocked my phone more than 20 times.</p>

<p>The main problem I see with Digital Wellbeing is that it doesn&rsquo;t easily show history or averages. You open the app and see your current consumption, but that info is not useful when it is not related to anything. The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982">Screen Time setting in iOS</a> shows averages and how that relates to prior weeks.</p>

<p>Still, while the information in Screen Time is interesting, it says I pick up my iOS devices (two iPads) on average 42 times a day, I have no idea what that means? Is it good? bad?</p>

         	<p>We saw Elton John last night for the first and last time, as this is his farewell tour and I believe it to be true. The show was fantastic, particularly when you consider that Elton is 71 years old. He played for a little over two and a half hours, with no intermission. After each song he would stand up, acknowledge the crowd as he did a circle around the piano seat, take a drink of water, sit down and launch into another song.</p>

<p>I’ve never seen a musical act with so much percussion. Two full drum sets, three drummers, including tympani, bells, and tambourine. The dude playing the tambourine, which was well miced, got more video time than the guitars. The act, however, had no cowbell.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple notes on Little Caesar’s Arena. It was the first concert that we attended at LCA. In an email the day before we were told the arena would open at 6:30 PM and encouraged people to come early, Elton was starting promptly at 8 PM. The arena didn’t open until 7 PM, which was very annoying.</p>

<p>We had seats in the upper bowl, which frankly were the cheapest seats. The climb to the seats in the upper bowl is pretty steep, and I felt bad for some of thr elderly and disabled who made the climb.</p>

         	<p>Google classifies the Pixel Slate as <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate">a Tablet with Google Assistant</a>. Based on <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/11/my-definition-of.html">my definition of tablets</a>, the Slate is not a tablet, it is a 2-in-1. If you stick to Google&rsquo;s view of it as a tablet then I stand by <a href="http://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/10/09/first-reaction-to.html">my initial impression</a> that the Slate could be DOA.</p>

<p>My concerns about it are driven by the total cost of ownership. I start with the 8 GB, 64 GB, Intel Core M model that costs $799, and then add a keyboard, either the Google keyboard that costs $199 or the <a href="https://www.brydge.com/pages/gtype-keyboard-for-google-pixel-slate">Brydge G-Type</a> that costs $159, making the minimum total cost $958; throw in the pen and that is just north of $1,000. For my money I much rather buy the Pixelbook or any one of the newer Chromebooks than pay $1000 for the Slate 2-in-1. Arguably <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-pro-6/8zcnc665slq5?icid=surfacedept_nav3_surfacefamily_100218&amp;activetab=pivot:techspecstab">the Surface Pro 6</a> is a better option, and it would definitely be better for me because I know I can use a pen with OneNote.</p>

<p>The Slate does look like a nice piece of hardware, and if you want Android and Linux apps on a 2-in-1 it&rsquo;s your only viable option, but is that option more appealing than an iPad Pro? Particularly a newer, larger screen, same form factor, smaller bezel iPad Pro? I am skeptical.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I do not think we should define a tablet as a screen without a keyboard, instead a tablet ought to be defined by how it is most commonly used, by which I mean you mostly use it in portrait orientation like one would a notepad of paper or a book.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a tablet has at least a 7-inch screen and is comfortable to hold and use for long periods of time with the device in a portriat orientation. Consequently devices that claim to be a tablet that have a 12-inch or larger screen are not really tablets, they really fall into a tweener (with notebooks), 2-in-1 category.</p>

<p>Based on how I use my iPad Pro 10.5, it is more a 2-in-1 because it is mostly used in landscape or when in portraint lying on a desk. By my defintion the only true tablets that I own are the iPad Mini 4 and the Nexus 9. The iPad and it&rsquo;s 9.7-inch screen is probably the largest screen size for a tablet.</p>

<p>My tablet use case definition might account for why tablets have not really overwhelmed the market. Apple had great initial success with the iPad, but sales started to taper off until the introduced the Pro line and significantly decreased the price of the regular iPad. The Pro line really fills the 2-in-1 market, while the lower price iPad has gained sales from holdouts who have wanted one the past but found them too expensive.</p>

<p>Further, by my defintion, the most successful tablet maker is likely Amazon with their cheap 7-inch and 8-inch tablets.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I have a hard time swallowing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17956202/google-pixel-3-price-expensive-why">the $150 price increase</a> between the Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel 3. I know Google can set prices the market will bear, but when I look at the difference I ask myself is the price increase due to higher costs or a desire for a higher profit margin?</p>

<p>Just about every Android phone that I have owned, from the original T-Mobile G1 to my current Pixel 2, has been either a Nexus or Made by Google phone because I value having the pure version of Android that is directly and quickly updated by Google. Having suffered during my Windows Mobile days of delayed software updates due to OEM timelines, I have tried to avoid such situations.</p>

<p>I want to keep using Pixel phones, Google seems to want to be in the premium priced smartphone market. What can be done? Google can follow Apple&rsquo;s lead into that premium market by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Continue to support older Pixel phones for several more future releases of Android. Google forced me to by a Pixel 2 because it announced Android 9 will not support the Nexus 6P, which I previously owned. In short Google should not continue only providing two operating system upgrades for their Pixel phones. The latest version of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-12/">iOS supports five generations</a> of iPhones and Android needs to do the same for Pixel phones.</p></li>

<li><p>Keep selling at least two generations of Pixel phones and lower the price of the older generation. Right now the Pixel 2 is still available at the Google Store, but for how long? I think Google needs to keep selling the Pixel 2 until it announces the Pixel 4, which then builds in a lower priced Pixel.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It seems clear to me that smartphone prices have gone up across the board because Apple increased the price of the iPhone. I don&rsquo;t like the iPhone prices either, but there is one big difference today between iPhone and Pixel. The iPhone you buy today will very likely be able to run the version of iOS released four years from now, so you don&rsquo;t need to buy a new iPhone in two years, you cannot say the same thing about Pixel.</p>

<p>The combination of the $150 price increase, Apple&rsquo;s practice to support older models of iPhones and selling older models at lower prices has me considering for the first time a switch to iPhone. I value the ability to receive updates direct from the source of the operating system.</p>

<p>I prefer Android smartphones and I don&rsquo;t want to switch, so I hope Google will make the changes I describe above. I also need to take a closer look at <a href="https://www.android.com/one/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwxvbdBRC0ARIsAKmec9bTgjNYnJ15XF1F-mkVu7nflgaw0voIk5MP2xEAMm3dJTzgbDVSttgaAse-EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;dclid=CJLe6oWB_N0CFYLewAodBBgKTA">Android One</a>, which may clean Android with updates from Google at a lower price. The bottom line is that Googe needs to know there is more to providing a premium phone than a price increase, and paying $800 for a phone that will only get operating system upgrades for two years makes no sense.</p>

         	<p>I am confused about the value of <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolenguyen/pixel-3-price-google-hands-on">the new Call Screen feature</a> that Google plans to add to Pixel phones. I assume the primary purpose is to screen telemarketing calls, but doesn&rsquo;t the very act of answering the call provide a signal that the number is valid? I was under the impression the best thing to do with telemarketing is to not answer the call.</p>

<p>Right now, if I get a call that I don&rsquo;t recognize, which is most, I decline the call. Period.</p>

         	<p>I am also not thrilled by the $799 starting price on the Pixel 3. I paid $649 for the Pixel 2, and wasn&rsquo;t entirely thrilled by that price. Given my use of tablets I have a hard time justifying paying more than $650 for a smartphone. Sadly, Pixel 2 may be my last Pixel phone at this pricing.</p>

         	<p>First reaction to the #madebygoogle event. Meh. I think the Pixel Slate is DOA with a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_slate_specs">starting price</a> of $599 for a 4GB RAM 32 GB storage tablet when one can by an iPad with 128 GB of storage for $429. The lowest price iPad Pro is $649, which is cheaper than a comparable Pixel Slate priced at $799.</p>

<p>Given these prices and how the compare with iPad, I don&rsquo;t understand why Google is even bothering with a tablet.</p>

&gt;The issue made national headlines in 2000, when Republican officials in Florida alleged that thousands of people with felony records were illegally registered to vote and needed to be removed from the rolls. African Americans made up only 11 percent of registered voters in the state but 44 percent of those on the purge list, which turned out to be riddled with errors. After the election, the state conceded that 12,000 eligible voters had been wrongly labeled as ex-felons and barred from voting. That was 22 times George W. Bush’s 537-vote margin of victory over Al Gore in Florida.</p>

<p>Active voter suppression and the result.</p>

The tablet will run the latest iteration of Chrome OS that runs Android and Linux apps.</p>

<p>Google does not have a tablet in its hardware lineup, so I understand it feels it has an opportunity to provide an alternative to the iPad. However, I am a bit skeptical about the potential for success. I think Apple may have what little there is of the tablet market sown up with the iPad.</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/pixel-slate-nocturne-intel-configurations-celeron-m3-i5-i7/">there could be four different models</a> of the Google tablet, no doubt to address different price points.

         	<p>The fact that Kavanaugh will obviously not be &ldquo;impartial&rdquo; as an umpire is not surprising and not the real problem. The real problem is that the people supporting Kavanaugh do not want him to be impartial, they want and fully expect him to make decisions along their party ideological lines. Our institutions are reflections of ourselves.</p>

<p>The root cause of this? <a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/12/24/my_horrible_right_wing_past_confessions_of_a_one_time_religious_right_icon/">White Christian America</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And that strategy was simple: Republican leaders would affirm their anti-abortion commitment to evangelicals, and in turn we’d vote for them — by the tens of millions. Once Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency, “we” would reverse Roe, through a constitutional amendment and/or through the appointment of anti-abortion judges to the Supreme Court or, if need be, through civil disobedience and even violence, though this was only hinted at at first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for the sake of the above, White Christian America gave up its integrity and moral authority, and it wonders why unaffliated is <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/">the fastest rising religion</a> in the United States.</p>

&gt;When Fred died of old age a few years later, all the employees gathered to pay their respects. During the dedication of a commemorative aquarium in the company’s main building, the founder of Anahata, a man named Bobby Bonilo, told his employees that it was Fred who had taught him how to run his company. Fred, he said, had proven that it was fine to have one eye and waddle if you were better than anyone else at doing those things.</p>

         	<p>Looking back, it occurs to me that <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org/2017/10/20/thereIsTeamInBaseball.html">my analysis</a> of the Cub&rsquo;s performance in last year&rsquo;s playoffs might be applicable to this year too.</p>

<p>The Cubs did make moves to address their bullpen, but the closer the signed, who pitched for the Dodgers last year, is not playing due to injury. The closer&rsquo;s backup is also not playing due to injury and the result is that all the remaining arms in the pen are doing things unexpected of them.</p>

         	<p>The Cubs and Brewers are playing game 163 starting at 1 PM EST to determine who wins the NL Central division and who will have the best record in the National League and with it home field advantage through the NL portion of the playoffs.</p>

<p>On paper the game appears to come down to momentum versus experience. The Brewers have won seven straight to finish the season and force this game, while the Cubs have been in the playoffs the last three years and won the world series in 2016.</p>

<p>For me the Cub&rsquo;s chances to win the game weigh heavily on Quintana&rsquo;s ability to keep Lorenzo Cain off the bases so that he can pitch around Yelich. Cub&rsquo;s need to hit and score runs early as the Brewer&rsquo;s bullpen is superior and this most likely will turn in to a bullpen game early. The Brewer&rsquo;s bullpen enables them to follow the same formula as the Royals did when they had their playoff runs.</p>

<p>Anxious to see how this turns out. While the Cubs at worse will end up with the second-best record in the NL, they go in to playoffs as the weakest team due to injury and the grind of playing on 40 of 41 days to end the season. In some ways this is a must win just to get a few days off, but I don&rsquo;t think Maddon will manage in such a manner.</p>

         	<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recommendation for a full vote on Kavanaugh demonstrates the value of diversity. All the Republicans on the committee are men who identified with Kavanaugh’s anger. Lindsey Graham seemed to channel it the most. In that moment it no longer mattered whether Kavanaugh is qualified for the job (I don’t think he is) or guilty of sexual assault because by god they like the man just because he got pissed off! And that too is how we end up with Trump as President because enough voters liked him and didn’t care about his ability to actually do the job.</p>

<p>Senators have a constitutional responsibility to determine whether a person is competent to be a Supreme Court justice and not just like the candidates. The Senators who supported Kavanaugh have failed their duty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We base everything from our private morality to our public policies and every major value in between on this nebulous thing called “rights.”&hellip;</p>

<p>But there are some issues with basing everything on rights. For one, they’ve tended to be negatively defined. “I won’t bother you if you don’t bother me.”&hellip;</p>

<p>This negative definition of rights is what inspired an entire book by the great 20th century German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer reflecting on the culture shock of his time spent teaching in New York. He was puzzled that we Americans seem to talk a lot about what we are “free from,” but hardly anyone ever brings up what we might be “free for.” Yes, there are all these things which we don’t want to infringe upon our lives. But what are we living for? What positive thing should we be seeking to enrich and improve our lives?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no secret that culturally at this point in time, discourse has devolved to the most acute volley of &ldquo;two wrongs make a right&rdquo; that we may have ever historically seen. We have taken this pathological diversion to a whole other level, to the point where we are able to create impasses that are so acute, they have the appearance of being impossible to transform out of. And I wonder sometimes, when we sit in our disintegrated state, if we want to move from the impasse. The impasse itself has become like a nice comfy couch to curl up on&rdquo;</p>

         	<p>I think there is a possibility for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/siri-shortcuts/">Siri shortcuts</a> to be a really big hit for Apple, and Google needs to beef up Assistant to match. Over time I expect Siri to speed up how you use your iOS device.</p>

<p>For example, right now I can tell Siri to open my blog and she starts Safari and opens this site. That saves me several taps. Right now I just made a shortcut to send text that I copy to the clipboard to Drafts. Highlight, copy to clipboard and then tell Siri to send this to Drafts.</p>

<p>And this is just with the built-in functionality, soon I will be able to &ldquo;program&rdquo; my own shortcuts.</p>

         	<p>I think the smart watch market is fascinating. On one hand you have Apple, with one design and software innovation and on the other hand you have a multitude of watch designers producing a variety of different looking watches at different price points using comparatively mediocre Wear OS. It also highlights the advantage of designing your own chips because Wear OS has been constrained by slow chip development by Qualcomm.</p>

<p>BTW, if one is in the market for a Wear OS watch, wait until when watches with the new chips release later this year, early next. I know a number of new watches are being released to coincide with the new version of Wear OS coming next month, but I expect the new chip to provide better battery life and processing for the future.</p>

So far I have had success. Before the reset the watch consumed 15% battery in an hour, today so far my watch has only consumed 7% in two hours. I only have a minimal set of apps on the watch, but I really think the problem occurred when I upgraded my phone to Android Pie. Moral is to do a reset upon such upgrades.</p>

         	<p>While you can configure the Gmail app to use the same categories as Inbox, Gmail does not have a simple way to archive all messages in a category. For example, I want to see all Updates, scan through the list, and quickly archive them after I&rsquo;ve read what I want to read. Gmail also does not have a button to snooze a message, but at least you can configure one of the two swipe actions to snooze.</p>

<p>Ack! Just realize that when I implemented categories (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums) in the Gmail app on my phone, that changes the web version of Gmail too. Worse, there is no single button way to archive all email of a category. You first have to select all messages and then buttons appear to mark read, archive, delete, etc..</p>

<p>So, Google, give me an easy way to archive all email in a category in Gmail and I will be unaffected by the demise of Inbox. Think about how fast it is to triage email in Inbox and enable that same capability in Gmail.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer</a> has been writing about owning and archiving what one writes and publishes on the web for a very long time. I think the heart of the matter is that if one is to think of the web as a library there has to be a mechanism for it to be long-lived.</p>

<p>In other words, permanence. The interesting thing is that many people dislike the web&rsquo;s permanence, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">European Union even has a law</a> in place intended to enable people to disrupt that permanence.</p>

<p>If you do see the value, however, there needs to be permanent access to what is written and a way to get to it. Permanently storing files is a whole lot easier than permanent access.</p>

<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/10/161928.html">Dave currently thinks</a> Github may be as good as anything given that it is owned by Microsoft, a company one expects will be around for a while Still, given that it is a corporate asset, Github exists at the pleasure of Microsoft and not the public.</p>

<p>To Dave&rsquo;s point, one thing I like about micro.blog is its support for Github. Micro.blog writes a copy of both the source markdown and the rendered HTML of what I write here to Github, and that provides one degree of backup. However, it gets even better because I use git to maintain a clone of that repository on my local computers, which provides me an easy backup copy of what I write on a computer I own.</p>

<p>The markdown is source for jekyll, which itself is an open source blog platform, and that source boils down to plain text files. BTW, jekyll itself works in this manner with Github pages which is good enough for many people, but I happen to like social layer and community that micro.blog provides.</p>

&gt;Human beings were so charmed by the illusion of control Newton’s metaphor offered that we began to see ourselves as machines too. Believing that Newton told us the truth about how the world works, we modeled our institutions on atomistic principles.
&hellip;
&gt;Our “God view” came to resemble our worldview. In this century, even much of our practical theology has also become mechanical and atomistic. Walk into many churches and you will hear God described as a being who behaves almost as predictably as Newton’s universe. Say you believe in God and you will be saved.  Sin against God and you will be condemned. Say you are sorry and you will be forgiven.  Obey the law and you will be blessed.</p>

&gt;The Benedict Church holds that orthodoxy or the true teaching of the Church resides in the unbroken apostolic tradition of the Petrine tradition, the men ordained and ontologically changed by the sacrament of Holy Orders.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the above is the closest I&rsquo;ve seen written to what I think is the root problem within the Roman Catholic church. It is too simplistic to state the problem is gay priests or celibacy or not ordaining women, all those are simply symptoms to the problem, a problem more closely related to why the Roman Catholic church exists as an institution.</p>

<p>The Founding Fathers were not unaware of the possibility that a demagogue or a knave might win the presidency. That’s why they checked the executive with an independent Congress and built in powers of impeachment. That Republicans in this Congress have proven so subservient to — or scared of — Trump that they have let the fate of the country hinge on whether his staff can adequately distract and calm him is a subversion of the constitutional order and an abdication of responsibility.</p>

&gt;Norms are created by institutions, and we live in an age of weak and despised institutions. This is how populist leaders arise: when a great many people believe that institutions exist merely to serve themselves, they come to despise not just those institutions but also the norms associated with them, and applaud leaders who scorn and seek to tear down the whole edifice.</p>

         	<p>I agree with <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/09/03/154301.html">Dave&rsquo;s high level plan</a>, for the Democrat strategy this fall. It&rsquo;s about Congress doing it&rsquo;s job, which is to oversee the executive branch regardless of the party badge of the person holding the office. Oversight must be first, then party goals and not vice versa, that is how the Constitution is structured to enable a functioning government.</p>

<p>The reason why some citizens may be willing to give up the republic for an authoritarian approach they think might be better is because of the ineffectiveness of Congress. Democrats have to remind and convince people that we ought not through out what actually is great about America.</p>

         	<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/opinion/tn-blr-me-intheory-20180904-story.html">In Theory: Does religious belief make the world more violent?</a></p>

<p>Understanding of the above question and a good answer require contemplation on the words  &ldquo;religious beliefs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beliefs most often translate into emotionally driven actions. People do certain things because they strongly feel (emotion) they are right.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;religion&rdquo; means to bind, so religious beliefs is a binding together of people with common beliefs, often translated in to emotion driven actions.</p>

<p>Religious and non-religious people have beliefs and emotions, removing religion isn&rsquo;t going to remove those beliefs.</p>

<p>One can say religion heightens those emotions. It can and has been a method for &ldquo;getting people worked up&rdquo; in such a way that emotions are heightened.</p>

<p>Here too there is nothing particularly unique about religion. Dictators and Presidents, atheist and believers, have and will conduct events that heighten emotions.</p>

<p>So, no, removing religious beliefs is not going to decrease or eliminate violence because emotions are part of who we are. Further, there will always be people who know how to manipulate emotions. Mature religion teaches us about our emotions, and helps us to know them and manage them. (Genesis 4:7) Mature religion is the antidote, not the problem.</p>

<p>Two months ago I determined the app needed more memory, so I decided it worth upgrading to the $10 per month, 1 vCPU and 1 GB of RAM plan.</p>

<p>Last month Amazon released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/pricing/?fl=sp2">new monthly pricing</a> that lowered the price of the 1 vCPU and 1 GB instance to $5 per month.</p>

         	<p>I don&rsquo;t get <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/09/03/after-nike-hires-colin-kaepern.html">the mindset of conservatives</a>. They say things like they want small government and want government out of people&rsquo;s lives and yet they want to dictate their beliefs to people with whom they disagree.</p>

<p>If America is about liberty, then one expressing that liberty by protesting is in fact a high form of patriotism.</p>

<p>Second, people need to understand that public displays of patriotism, which is what standing during a national anthem is, is done by non-democratic countries too. Such displays are not uniquely American. See above for what is uniquely American.</p>

<p>Finally, in my upbringing kneeling is a sign of reverence. One can make the argument that kneeling is even a higher display of respect than standing. If Colin and the other NFL players did something like turn their back, or lie down, or start break dancing THAT would be disrespectful.</p>

<p>Worse, what is most disrespectful to veterans is not voting. Actively working to prevent citizens from voting. Not challenging the President when he sends our military in to conflict. And not demanding that Congress uphold its constitutional responsibility to declare war. Wouldn&rsquo;t making sure every vet gets the physical and mental health care they need be a true sign of respect? What is more respectful, actually caring about active military and veterans or puttinng on appearances of respect?</p>

<p>P.S. Go to any sporting event and you will find people walking, talking, and otherwise not paying attention during the national anthem.</p>

It would be nice to see a video of the changes, but apparently that has not been provided by Google.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been running the new version of Google Fit for four days, and I am pretty happy with the change. I had already made the mental shift from steps to move minutes. Fit has even suggested in an increase in my goals after using the defaults and monitoring my activity for a few days.</p>

<p>One problem that I do have with my watch, which is a Fossil Q Explorist, is that the battery life has been worse since upgrading my phone to Android P. I am not sure that is the exact correlation, but it feels to be the case.

         	<p>I like <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/26/161533.html">what Dave writes here</a> about Inclusivity. However, while it may be a slight nit, I think the two views of America has been liberty versus equality.</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence is an aspiration statement of all men being equal, although we know that black men where not considered men at that time. Nor were women considered equal with men. The United States was written to define and contain our government and therefore maintain our liberty.</p>

<p>Over the centuries we have been striving towards the aspiration of the Declaration but clearly not all people are on board. Some would say the push for true equality is impinging on their liberty.</p>

<p>Here is the thing&hellip;we think liberty is about our government, but on its own it says nothing about what one does with that liberty. Some will claim it makes them free to do whatever they want, while others will say it makes us free to make the best society for everyone.</p>

         	<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the fixation with creating note taking applications that support markdown. Markdown is a markup language and by definition markup is used for presentation or publishing content.</p>

<p>Markdown makes sense for indicating how you want writing to appear in a published format like a web page or a document. But, do I really need markdown for raw text-based notes that I really am not going to publish? For me marked up content is harder to read.</p>

<p>An example of where I see markdown being used the wrong way is in Noteplan. I can markup my notes for <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic</em> but I don&rsquo;t just see the rendered result I see the markup, asterisks and underlines AND the bold and italic that that is harder for me to read.</p>

<p>It is not obvious how to download your fitness data and Google doesn&rsquo;t really provide much in the way of analyzing data. When looking at data like this you want to see trends so you can answer questions like, did I walk more than last week? Did I walk more than last month? Last year? Improvement is measured over time not in a point of time. It is shocking to me that a company that bills itself as data driven is does not provide much, if anything, for analyzing this data.</p>

         	<p>In my opinion, there is a problem with viewing the Internet as publicly owned. The Internet is corporate owned and has been for some time and corporations who own it are going to make decisions that are in their best interests.</p>

<p>No part of the Internet is publicly owned, the last vestiges of that were given up when the FCC killed net neutrality.</p>

<p>If we truly want a free and open Internet we need to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets">build a new one</a> that is not controlled by corporations. <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/08/16/132055.html">You can talk all you want about how you want companies to act</a>, but they will not act in the public&rsquo;s best interests unless it just happens to coincided with their own interests.</p>

<p>Yes, there are companies like Apple that give the impression they do make decisions in the public&rsquo;s best interests, but I think Apple&rsquo;s stances on privacy are self serving, it is their competitive differentiator.</p>

<p>You can say much the same thing about the corporate owned media in the United States. The press that existed at the time the first amendment was written is different than how how it exists today.</p>

<p>There is little to no concept of &ldquo;public square&rdquo; today because nearly motive is driven by profit and no where enough motive is driven by public good.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the press needs to just do its job. One thing that I do think might be helpful is to point out that every president has issues with the press, they likely can produce past video of democrat and republican presidents taking issue with them.</p>

<p>And here is the thing, in this context, <strong>the President of the United States is not &ldquo;the people.&rdquo;</strong> Consequently, a press that does NOT explicitly agree with the President is NOT an enemy of the people, if anything they may be an enemy of the President.</p>

<p>Trump promotes the idea that he is just &ldquo;one of us.&rdquo; He, like all Presidents before him, is not just one of us.</p>

<p>The President serves us, and the Congress, the Supreme Court and yes, the Press, are the institutions identified by the founders of our country as being responsible to make sure the President serves faithfully by upholding his oath. By definition this means that when a person takes the oath of President of the United States, that person ceases being just one of us.</p>

         	<p>Most political decisions are being made based on emotions and not fact because emotion-based decision making has been taught to us by media ever since the first advertisement. The Internet is optimized for advertising and therefore emotion. And at the end of day, every opinion expressed on the Internet, including this one, is advertising.</p>

<p>For example, there is no skepticism applied when one is telling another what they want to hear. When a politician holds a rally for their base, does anyone attending that rally ask themselves why the event is being held? What is the purpose? Is that I am being told true, or simply being said to earn my support.</p>

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/08/13/my-microblog-wish.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-08-13 17:05:57 -0500">Aug 13, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I think of micro.blog as a publishing platform, for two reasons. First, what I write is published to <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog">my blog</a>. Second, what I write is published to other distribution channels, specifically for me <a href="https://twitter.com/frankm">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/writtenbyfrank">Facebook</a>, but it could also include Medium and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>What would make micro.blog perfect for me is the ability to designate, at the time I am writing, to which distribution channels I want a particular item published to. All things that I write are appropriate for my blog, but some things I might only want to also be published to Twitter and yet other things I would prefer published to Facebook.</p>

<p>To me, the ability to control what gets published where, from the app in which I am writing, is particularly important if I were to publish to the LinkedIn and Medium channels that could be considered more &ldquo;professional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Right now, cross-posting is all or nothing. Everything I write in micro.blog is cross posted to Twitter and Facebook and frankly some posts, like this one, don&rsquo;t make sense for those audiences.</p>

<p>I recognize there are drawbacks to cross posting, specifically, it&rsquo;s a write once experience meaning that edits don&rsquo;t get re-published to Twitter and Facebook because there just isn&rsquo;t a mechanism to do so.</p>

<p>I fear calling the web a public square, thinking that is is truly open, is a myth. All of the infrastructure upon which the web runs is owned by corporations. The technology upon which the web is built is intended to be open, but they are under control of corporations.</p>

<p>Corporations pushed the web towards HTML5 in support of apps that they utlimately control. Corporations own the browsers that we use and with coding changes can force all of use towards a direction they want. The network infrastructure upon which the packets ride are owned by corporations who can, and have, allowed governments to capture and review those packets.</p>

<p>Sure, you can host content on a web server running in your house. What happens when Comcast or AT&amp;T decides to not sell Internet access to you? What happens when the coporations that control DNS remove your domain from their servers, or direct requests somewhere else?</p>

<p>None of this is truly open. All of it is at risk if it does not serve coporate interests. Right now the best we have are degrees of openness.</p>

First, I note that all reviews are of the high-end, 8 GB model. Second, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that everyone is desperate for a competitor to the iPad and therefore will praise up any attempt.</p>

<p>Personally, I think the main issue is price. At a minimum Microsoft should be bundling the keyboard with the device at the price of that $650 price. I would love to see info on how many Surfaces are sold without keyboard.</p>

<p>Now, it may look as though I am really down on the Surface Go, while I think I am neutral. I do think that if you are looking at a device for viewing video, you might want to give the Go a ago because of the built-in stand. If you just consume content you can live without the keyboard and stylus.</p>

&gt;In Behold, America, a fascinating new look at “the entangled history” of “America First” and “the American Dream,” out this fall, Sarah Churchwell unearths a 1900 editorial in the New York Post fretting about how multimillionaires “are very rarely, if ever, content with a position of equality.” The paper hypothesized that “the American dream,” a term not yet in common parlance, could be ended by their greed. A similar 1908 editorial in the Leavenworth, Kansas, Times, again invoking “American dreams,” championed “the equitable distribution of wealth” while making pointed note of the vast discrepancy between the pay of an insurance-company executive and a headmaster: “Why do we accord highest place to money mongers and lowest place to teachers of ideals?”</p>

Blogs abide the reality that we make mistakes and provides an easy why to correct those mistakes, and social networks do not.</p>

<p>One strange thing syndicating to Wordpress is that just about every post I make there gets liked by someone new. While I know some of the likes are from real people, it feels like bots.</p>

<p>I bought the Surface 3 because of its support for an active digitizer. Now that the iPad supports the Apple Pencil and it is cheaper than the Surface Go, it would be really hard for me to pick the Go over the iPad.</p>

<p>Ever since I bought the iPad Pro 10.5 my Surface 3 has been relegated to role as my only computer running Windows 10. I picked up a refurbed dock for a low price, and the Surface 3 sits in that dock pretty much unused until I have a need to run Windows on a computer that I own. So far all releases of Windows 10 run on it, so I don&rsquo;t really have a need to replace or retire it until it can no longer be patched.</p>

         	<p>While I am at it, despite that I use <a href="https://micro.blog">micro.blog</a>, I have to confess that I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;get&rdquo; micro.blogs. Perhaps I am being too literal. To me, a blog, is a blog, but there are titleless posts and posts with titles. Blogging back in 1999 was oriented around dates, and a weblog was a log of what one saw and reacted to on the web on a particular date. (In otherwords, titleless posts.)</p>

<p>Now, I do get the idea of <a href="https://kfitz.info/feeds-and-gardens/">coherent interaction relating to a blog post</a> that is probably the real, special sauce, to micro.blog. Back in 1999 we tried to implement this concept through link backs, but that had the challenge of notification of when someone did a link back so that you can participate in the &ldquo;conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">Webmentions</a> may be a better technlogical implementation of the link back concept. Ironic that the micro.blog blog doesn&rsquo;t seem to support it.</p>

<p>Again, being honest, I don&rsquo;t write what I write on my blogs for the comments or the likes or the shares. I selfishly write for me, and if you the reader get value out of what I write, all the better.</p>

         	<p>My first computer was the <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/ts1000.html">Timex Sinclair</a> 1000 that my grandmother gave me as a birthday present in 1983. I got that computer because it was cheap enough for my grandmother to buy, and she somehow determined back then that computers where the future.</p>

<p>One of the unique things about the TS1000 is that it had a membrane keyboard and each key had multiple functions, most notably certain function key combinations produced BASIC reserve words geared towards making it easy to learn how to program. The TS1000&rsquo;s keyboard could be seen today as a predecessor to today&rsquo;s on-screen keyboards.</p>

<p>Back in the 80s and early 90s all personal computers came with an operating system and the BASIC programming language. While you could buy some pre-packaged software, the most common way to add programs to a computer was by either writing yourself or by typing one that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2012/12/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/">printed in a magazine</a>.</p>

<p>The TS1000 was an educational computer and the forefather to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> that you can buy today for as little as $30. I have several Raspberry Pis that I tinker with, and I think parents ought to buy them for any child who is at all interested in studying computers.</p>

         	<p>What scares me most is that Trump supporters do not appear to have lines, by which I mean there is nothing Trump can do that will lose their support. Ought right determination to not change one’s mind, no matter what is frightening. Progress requires an openness to admitting that one is wrong.</p>

<p>I have mixed feeling about this news. As time has past I have accepted the series is done and moved on. In some ways it would be nice to leave it be. On the other hand, knowing Joss is behind this has me curious to see where he takes the story. I think Joss is smart enough to know a reboot cannot try to be the same. In the meantime, lots can happen for this to not happen.</p>

         	<p>I recently rewrote <a href="https://frankm.org">my profile page</a> and implemented HTTPS using Amazon S3 and Cloudfront.  In my opinion S3 provides one of the easiest and least expensive ways to host a simple, static web site. Unfortunately HTTPS adds complexity, both in what you need to do to build the site and also in how you maintain it.</p>

<p>I did a brief survey and I think that that the simplest way to set up a web site with HTTPS is to host with a service like <a href="https://www.bluehost.com">Bluehost</a>, which provides a free SSL certificate. <a href="https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/141#shared">Bluehosts&rsquo;s $8.99/month price</a> is reasonable, but not as cheap as Amazon for a really small site like mine, which is a single HTML page.</p>

<p>So, in my opinion with the current push to HTTPS,  you are better off going with a service provider that includes HTTPS as part of the service. If you are more technical and willing to fiddle with things, you can save money with S3/Cloudfront.</p>

The big difference is that you can&rsquo;t associate a custom domain to the free tier, you will have to pay for the VM and it looks like you will need to buy a certificate.

<p>From the author:
&gt;&ldquo;Eventually two points occurred to me. The first is that many of our fiercest disputes occur because the people involved simply aren’t thinking: they’re reacting or emoting or virtue-signaling or ingroup-identifying. The second is that I have spent my entire career thinking and trying to teach others to think.&rdquo;</p>

When I was growing up the nearest grocery store, one of these corner stores, was DeRidders. In the late 70s a fire gutted the building and the owner built a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uGbj5AdMq6K2">much smaller &ldquo;party&rdquo; store across the U.S. highway from the old site</a>.</p>

<p>In its day DeRidders was one of maybe a half dozen grocery stores in my small home town. Four were located on the three quarter mile long Main Street. Today only one grocery store remains in my home town, and it competes with a Walmart Superstore ten miles away.</p>

<p>The fun begins when you make changes to said web page and they never seem to appear, even though you know for certain the latest version of that page is in the bucket. Turns out you need to invalidate that page in the Cloudfront console to force it to be refreshed in the cache. Along the way I made changes to the TTL for the page.</p>

         	<p>Today I wrote a <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/ipad/2018/07/05/using-noteplan-to-manage-personal-projects.html">new article</a> on my site hosted by Netlify that includes an image that I have stored in a S3 bucket. The bucket is not set up for HTTPS. Netlify has sent me an email that mixed, insecure content has been detected on my blog.</p>

<p>Sigh. Now I have to go and figure out how get that bucket, which is hosting my <a href="http://frankm.org">personal profile</a> set up with HTTPS. Fortunately, it is a simple bucket, but really, this whole ham-handed push to HTTPS is getting old, fast.</p>

         	<p>Micro.blog has a setting that I’ve been using that sends a copy of my content to a Github repo, and if that repo is configured for <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a> then you basically end up with a second copy of your micro.blog site.</p>

<p>When I changed the theme for this blog the Jekyll build at Github started to fail. Every time I post something here I was getting error messages from Github. So, this afternoon I’ve been trying to fix the problem, deciding to just remove all the contents in Github and start over.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, now that I have removed everything, and even generated a new access token, nothing is transferring from here to there. I don’t know whether I broke something over perhaps exceeded some time of commit limit on a public repo.</p>

<p>I wonder if I can put it into a new repo?</p>

         	<p>What do you think about blog archives? I personally like a index of post blog posts that I&rsquo;ve written to make it easier to go back and see my writing at that time. <a href="http://reader.smallpicture.com/?opmlurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdl.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fh44njkhogn65tpq%2FwebnotesArchive.opml%3Fdl%3D0#">The software</a> I used in the past made it easy to see those monthly archives, but micro.blog does not. I can create an index using <a href="https://fjmnotes.com">a Wordpress site</a>, but I think I would prefer something built in to micro.blog.  If I were a programmer I suspect the JSON feed would be useful.</p>

         	<p>You may have noticed that I made a change to the layout and appearance of this site. The new theme is similar in appearance to the theme on <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net">my Jekyll site</a>. I may be contrarian, but I prefer blogs that make text easier to read over blogs that emphasize graphics. (I also dislike white text on black backgrounds because that messes up my eyes.)</p>

<p>One thing that I notice is that in this format the date of the post is at the top of the post, giving the appearance of a title and that makes me wish that such posts were all consolidated on to one page like <a href="http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net">previous incarnations</a> of my blog.</p>

         	<p>Well, that was interesting. I updated my Pi3 with the latest release of Raspbian and then decided to clone my new Jekyll repo and edit <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/about/">the about page</a> on my Raspberry Pi. Just because I could. I committed and pushed the update to the repo and checked the about page on the new site, and the new edits did not appear. Went to the Netlify site, logged in, and found the deploy failed with some error relating to node. I think during deploy nodejs 8 was attempted to be installed and it failed.</p>

<p>Next, I tried a fresh re-deploy and selected clear cache and this time deployment was successful.</p>

<p>So, what I learned here is that it appears whenever Netlify sees and pulls an update from the repo it seems to rebuild the container/VM that is hosting the site that includes installing nodejs, installing ruby gems (Jekyll uses ruby) then does a Jekyll build and ultimately deploys the site from the site fielder.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/06/30/long-form-writing.html">Long Form Writing and Trying Out Netlify</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/06/30/long-form-writing.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-06-30 10:38:04 -0500">Jun 30, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Unlike most others here at micro.blog, I consider <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/">my micro.blog</a> as my blog. The reason is that I distinguish blogs from long form writing and publishing on the Internet. For me, a blog post is 1 to 3 paragraphs and written in about 15 minutes or less.</p>

<p>I blog to share a thought or something of interest to me, I write to formulate and share ideas.</p>

<p>When I set up my micro.blog account and associated a personal blog domain to it, I decided that I would use my then current blog, <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">Let&rsquo;s Be Frank</a>, for long form writing. The &ldquo;broad&rdquo; push to HTTPS is going to make that a problem because that blog is managed using an app written by Dave Winer called <a href="http://1999.io">1999.io</a>, and it has a lot of Javascript libraries that I don&rsquo;t think he is every going to convert to HTTPS.</p>

<p>So, stay there and maybe figure out how to convert to HTTPS or look somewhere else? I recently <a href="https://www.baty.net/2018/back-to-netlify/">learned about Netlify from Jack Baty</a> and after checking out its web site, I determined it has much of what I was looking for: <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">low price</a>, easy HTTPS implementation, and flexibility.</p>

<p>Netlify does not provide a Content Management System, but it integrates with Github to provide continuous deployment, so you can use static site generators like Jekyll for publishing content. Since I have a little experience with Jekyll, I decided to try out Netlify by following <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/">their Jekyll tutorial</a> and it didn&rsquo;t take me long to get a site up and available via HTTPS.</p>

<p>The upside with the approach I have so far is that I can write and publish content from any device, particularly my iPad. All you really need to do is add a file in the proper naming format to the posts folder of your Github repository. I&rsquo;ve cloned the repository to Working Copy on my iPad and found a Drafts action that will save a new item to Working Copy and insert the proper header informatation that Jekyll requires.</p>

<p>Right now <a href="https://writing.frankmcpherson.net">the new site</a> is very much a work in progress and there may be changes. Oh, and I am aware of the irony of me writing this post here but this is is where you know me and I am not a stickler to such self determined rules.</p>

         	<p>I think I know what happened. With previous posts I published from Ulysses I did not enable markdown in the publishing dialog and therefore the publisher converted the markdown to HTML so it appeared correct in Wordpress. In the previous post I enabled markdown, and since Wordpress was not configured to use markdown it did not render properly. So, to have enabled markdown in the writing settings of the WP-Admin console, which fixed the problem.</p>

         	<p>Too many people in the United States think our government will be overthrown by force when the reality is it is happening in just the opposite manner. The strong arguments against gun control in the U.S. is evidence of this, as the argument centers around needing to keep guns as protection against government oppression. The powers that be don&rsquo;t need to take guns away, they just need us to keep arguing about them, which fossilizes idealogy and keeps attention away from what is really happening.</p>

<p>The constitution enables authoritarianism when Congress and the Supreme Court do not function in their jobs as overseers of the Presidency. When Congress and the Supreme Court simply align with a president due to party affliation, you have a dictator in practice.</p>

<p>Today the process nearly complete, and gerrymandering will seal the deal. Gerrymandering removes the one power citizens have, which is to vote. You don&rsquo;t need to burn down the flag nor rip up the Constitution, all that is needed is idealogical compliance to what the Presidency wants.</p>

         	<p>I like Drafts, but I think the concept behind it is nonsensical. The idea of Drafts is that you use it to write and edit any text that you can then send to other apps, which also have the capability to write and edit text. So, you see &ldquo;actions&rdquo; in Drafts for entering tasks in apps like OmniFocus and Todoist, but why is that easier than just entering information in Microblog, OmniFocus and Todoist? It seems to me that people who use iOS for productivity are so enamored by the workflows they have created they don&rsquo;t seem to realize the workflows are basically workarounds for deficiencies that existed in previous versions of iOS.</p>

<p>I am finding the number of iOS apps that basically do the same thing insane! Really, how many markdown editors are needed?</p>

<p>My one request of Apple is to add mouse support to the iPad. Apple can look at how Windows and Android handle mouse support on touchscreens, it can’t be that hard.</p>

         	<p>Tolerance is fundamental to freedom. If we stop tolerating actions or opinions that we disagree with, you stop freedom, democracy disappears and is replaced by dictatorship. The irony is for the idea that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful and should not be tolerated, we are giving up the very freedom that too many gave their lives for.</p>

<p>You can not dictate respect. Dictating respect is counter to tolerance and is counterproductive because respect is earned, not given.</p>

<p>Do you really want freedom? If you do, it starts by tolerating those with whom you disagree and not treating them with contempt.</p>

<p>In a democracy the leader does not dictate behavior, that is called dictatorship.

<p>The question is whether regular users will benefit from this feature. Most likely not if nothing more than the actual number of Linux apps a “regular user” might find useful are limited.

         	<p>One thing I find frustrating about iOS are the number of apps that all seem to do the exact same thing. How do you decide on one over the other? An example is Drafts and Ulysses, both are good markdown editors but Drafts supports more automation. Last summer I was looking for a new editor and Ulysses came highly recommended, so I bought it, but then the company switched to a subscription model and that turned me off, I decided to not buy in to the subscription.</p>

<p>Then I learned about Drafts, and so I went and downloaded it and have used it to write some blog posts. To date I have mostly used it to write long posts for <a href="http://writing.frankmcpherson.org">one site</a> that only has a &ldquo;basic&rdquo; web-based editor. Of course, Drafts has now been recently upgraded and it too has a subscription model.</p>

<p>To me, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have Ulysses and Drafts on my iPad, Drafts seems to able to do the job good enough. However, so far I have not seen an Action for sending text to Wordpress, which I find a bit surprising. Does anyone know of such an Action? The one in the Drafts directory appears to require components not part of Wordpress.com.</p>

         	<p>You might think it too fine a point, but I think any blogging product requires the ability to edit what one has written. To me, editing is a fundamental difference between blogging and social networks because blogging is about permanence where as the social network timeline/newsfeed is a black hole.</p>

<p>To me, what makes micro blogging different from social networks like Twitter is the permance I describe above, and therefore editing should be a fundamental requirement for all micro blogging apps.</p>

         	<p>Google has released the new version of Gmail, which I am checking out. I have been using, and like, Inbox mostly because how quickly I can use it to triage email. By triage I mean browse for messages I want to read and then quickly archiving all the remaining messages. No other app, including Gmail provides as easy a way to archive a group of messages.</p>

<p>The downside of Inbox is that it is very JavaScript heavy and therefore the web app performance can suffer. Another downside is that the app versions don’t look as good on larger screens such as on my 10.5 iPad Pro in landscape.</p>

<p>So, I am considering using Gmail on large screens and Inbox on small screens. However to decide that, I need to use the new Gmail for a while.</p>

         	<p>Did a little more investigation into <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/04/22/i-got-a.html">the watch face that Fossil &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; to my smart watch last weekend</a>. What happens is, you receive a notification saying that you &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; a face and whether you want to enable it. What I have found is that amongst the many faces that are pre-installed on the watch is one called Seasonal, and this is the face that Fossil pushes updates to. Consequently, Fossil is not consuming additional storage space on the watch with each &ldquo;new face&rdquo; as it is updating one face that is designed for different appearances, which in reality is how all faces work.</p>

<p>I am wondering whether there is a Wear OS app that will automatically change watch faces I specify on a set schedule. I would like to rotate through some like the Outlook face that I like to use during the work day.</p>

         	<p>What, if any, relationship is there between free speech and cable TV, and in particular news or opinion shows on cable TV? Cable TV is not the public square nor is it public airwaves, it is corporate owned and exists for the purposes of making money. The primary method for making money is advertising.</p>

<p>If people opt to make note of the advertisers and decide to not purchase products from those advertisers, which is known as boycotting their products, I don&rsquo;t see how in any way that infringes on a person&rsquo;s free speech rights. At most it infringes on that person&rsquo;s ability to make money on cable TV.</p>

<p>Furthermore, free speech is a protection for citizens from government. If cable TV is not part of the government, then frankly I am not clear on what free speech rights apply to anything on cable TV. Claims about being &ldquo;fair and balanced&rdquo; is marketing and not statements of facts nor rights.</p>

         	<p>Google Assistant is still flawed by not enabling users to specify unique trigger words for each device. So, I use my smartphone as an alarm clock and I thought it would be cool to enable <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home/google-assistant-routines/">the Bedtime routine</a> that turns down the phone, sets an alarm and shuts off lights.</p>

<p>Problem is that routine is enabled for Home and my Pixel phone. So, if I initiate the routine with the two in the same room, Home takes over and then sets the alarm for itself rather than on my phone.</p>

<p>So, I think Google needs to do two things. First, it should provide a way to associate specific routines to specific assistant-enabled devices. Second, it needs to provide a way for users to create trigger words that are specific to devices. Right now, I can squeeze to trigger assistant on my phone and then start the routine, but that requires me to remember this rather than assistant being smart enough to remember for me.</p>

Immediately on Twitter are the gun control/anti-control fanatics tweeting away. What is always lost is context. The problem isn&rsquo;t necessarily this one event, the problem is that this event is just the lastest instance of something much larger.</p>

<p>Right now, all we have are advocates of each side of the solution yelling at each other so that <strong>nothing is being done.</strong> So, from where I stand the real issue at this moment is the fact that we doing nothing but just live with the problem, which is a sign for how low our society has fallen.</p>

         	<p>In her article titled &ldquo;<a href="https://points.datasociety.net/alternative-facts-alternative-truths-ab9d446b06c">Alternative Facts, Alternative Truths</a>&rdquo; I think Dr. Francesca Tripodi provides a good example of the consequence of dualism as taught by fundamentalist churches. Issues like gun control, racism, and patriarchy do involve emotion as well as fact. In my opinion, just about all big decisions involve emotions.</p>

<p>In the matter of the Evangelical church&rsquo;s view of Trump, what I think this article shows is missing is context. If all you look for are the words you like, and don&rsquo;t stop to consider that the person providing them knows that and is intentionally saying them with no history to back them up, there is going to be a problem.</p>

         	<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare/twenty-states-sue-federal-government-seeking-end-to-obamacare-idUSKCN1GB06R">Twenty states have filed suit</a> against the federal government basically because there is no business model in healthcare insurance. Before we can fix problems we have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Agree on what is the problem</li>
<li>Agree that the problem needs to be fixed</li>
<li>Understand that the solution to every problem (healthcare) is not a hammer called capitalism</li>
<li>Agree on fundamental principles</li>
</ol>

<p>Fundamentally, the business model for insurance is based on the premise that a company pays out less money than it takes in through people buying insurance. Property insurance works because it is possible that people who pay for it never need to file a claim through their life time. Likewise auto insurance works because there are people who never have to file a claim over a lifetime of driving.</p>

<p>In context, there really is no such thing as health insurance because every health care transaction is paid by the &ldquo;health insurance&rdquo; companies and just about everyone has one or more healthcare transactions per year. In other words, how does a &ldquo;health insurance&rdquo; company make money? If auto insurance was like healthcare, ever time one took their car in for an oil change or a tire rotation they would file an auto insurance claim.</p>

<p>Basically, we have to stop thinking that there is a capitalistic solution to the cost of health care. Just about all other countries around the world came to this realization and did something about it. We in the United States have drunk the capitalistic koolaid so much that we have forgotten our own history and just run around trying to hammer away every single problem.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/01/30/feedback-on-the.html">Feedback On The OmniFocus Roadmap</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://frankmcpherson.blog/2018/01/30/feedback-on-the.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-01-30 13:57:54 -0500">Jan 30, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A couple of thoughts about OmniFocus after reading <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2018">Omni&rsquo;s roadmap for 2018</a>.
As an iOS user but not a Mac OS user, I have long heard about OmniFocus and how great it is but never tried it out. A few weeks ago I discovered I could install the iOS version and try it out for free for two weeks, which I did and frankly, it didn&rsquo;t seem much better than Todoist or 2Do.</p>

<p>My main requirement is multi-platform support because while use an iPad as my primary personal computer, I  also use Android smartphones and Windows notebook computers. The inability to get to info in OmniFocus from Windows has been a show stopper, and web access, which is on the roadmap, will help, however I am concerned about the &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; plan.</p>

<p>A simple way that Omni could solve this problem is by syncing with Toodledo. While there is a Toodledo iOS app, it is not very efficient so I use 2Do on my iPad that syncs my data with Toodledo. The benefit is that there are Toodledo apps for other platforms, and the Toodledo web app is one of the most advanced web apps that I use.</p>

<p>I am also surprised that OmniFocus doesn&rsquo;t use an outliner for editing projects and tasks, given the existence of OmniOutliner, which I do use.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep a watch out for the next release of OmniFocus and probably check it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stirring of leaves in the wind makes the wind visible. Their stirring is the wind’s stirring, their whisper is the wind’s whisper. And so with love. Our actions of love make the invisible visible. Our actions of love make love present to ourselves and to others. And as we go out of ourselves in love, and become, as it were, lost in those we love, we discover a self-greater than our isolated ego. We discover the birth of that self born of the death to self-centeredness.&rdquo; from &ldquo;Merton&rsquo;s Palace of Nowhere&rdquo; by James Finley, Henri J. M. Nouwen</p>

<p>One might not agree with the entire premise of the above article, but I think there is something to the point being made that we wrongly think markets/capitalism is the solution to every problem in our country. In fact, one can make the argument that capitalism is the root of much that is wrong in our country.</p>

<p>For example, the reality is capitalism (read revenue and profits) is the true reason why the NRA agressively opposes any gun control; the NRA&rsquo;s corporate supporters make a lot of money off the sale of guns and ammunition and logically do not want any of that money to be at risk. Just like capitalism drove the tobacco industry to ignore studies showing smoking causes cancer.</p>

<p>For a long time I have been saying that we tend to confuse capitalism with democracy. I think this is reflected most prominently by the <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/">Citizens United</a> SCOTUS ruling that says corporate spending on politics is a form of free speech, and thus corporations have a right to free speech.</p>

<p>Corporations are a construct of capitalism, they are not in themselves men or women of any race. In otherwords, corporations are not citizens.</p>

<p>Citizens United may be the worst SCOTUS ruling of my lifetime. Worse, it is reflects a flawed understanding that frankly skews society in favor of corporations and the oligarchs that profit from them.</p>

         	<p>It&rsquo;s the beginning of the year and therefore the time for my yearly ritual of trying to find a to-do (task management) app that I like and think that I will use. I am again finding myself with <a href="http://www.toodledo.com">Toodledo</a>, mostly because it has more filtering features that other apps and because it has a robust web app. However, Toodledo does not have a robust iOS app.</p>

<p>The Toodledo iOS app does the job but doesn&rsquo;t have the best UI. However, I have found that 2Do syns with Toodledo so I am giving that a try. At worst I can toggle between the two apps because they sync with the same data.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, 2Do does not sync Toodledo&rsquo;s statuses, so if I want the same functionality I need to create tags rather that statuses.</p>

<p>What you see is computers with nearly the same clock speed and number of cores but widely different performance. I think it shows that while the physical performance (clock speed) is nearly the same, newer chips perform better due to all the parallel processing occuring within the chip.</p>

         	<p>Later today Michigan Tech will play Bowling Green in the championship game of the 53rd Great Lakes Invitational hockey tournament. It is the first GLi at the new Little Caesars&rsquo;s Arena and is hosted by Michigan Tech.</p>

<p>Either of the potential opponents for Tech in the championship presented interesting story lines. Had Michigan won Tech would be facing their former coach, Mel Pearson, who just left his Alma mater to become Michigan&rsquo;s head coach. Tech&rsquo;s return to college hockey prominence started when Pearson took the helm.</p>

<p>Pearson&rsquo;s last game as Tech&rsquo;s head coach was the 2017 WCHA championship game in which <a href="http://www.wcha.com/men/pres1617/201703/mar12wcm.php">the Huskies beat Bowling Green</a> to take the Broadmore Trophy and the NCAA tourney bid.

<p>If we think deeply about the consequences of debt you see meaning. Holding debt over a person is to have power over that person. The person in debt therefore is more or less a slave to the person (or thing) that has power over them. One of the earliest themes of what Jesus did for us was to set us free.</p>

<p>As we in the United Stated look more and more like the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferengi">Ferengie</a> every day, it may be helpful to replace the word &ldquo;sin&rdquo; with &ldquo;debt&rdquo; more often.</p>

<p>Looks like I will have to remove the Zero and flash the card with a complete build on a PC. I hope that  I can get the Zero out of he case without breaking it.</p>

<p>Probably because they don&rsquo;t think there is a serious risk of going to jail. The country, and what most will accept is much different now than during Watergate. I doubt we will ever see a Republican tell Trump he should resign as he is sure to be impeached.</p>

<p>Apparently, when something I ordered is delivered to the locker, I will get an email with a six digit code that I then use at the locker location to retrieve my package.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Despite scientific research and Congressional hearings, the NFL is still not serious about the safety of its players due to concussions. In fact, the current NFL rules <strong>rewards</strong> teams of players who inflict a concussion.</p>

<p>The latest example occurred during the Packers and Panthers game on December 17. During the game Panther Thomas Davis launched into Davante Adams resulting in Adams being removed for the game due to the obvious helmet-on-helmet hit. A personal foul was called on Davis, but he remained in the game while the Packers lost one of their most important players.</p>

<p>Players who may be concussed must be removed from play until doctors confirm it is ok for him to return. In this case, the right thing happened while that has not always been the case. However, how is it that the player causing the injury, unnecessarily, is still allowed to play?</p>

<p>Treating concussions is important but equally important is preventing concussions from happening in the first place, and that will not happen without immediate and significant enforcement on the field. All direct hits to the head should result in an immediate ejection, and this rule should be enforced not only by on field officials but also by replay. At a minimum the NFL ought to have a booth review, as is the case with the NCAA, but I favor the booth being able to eject such players at any time.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the current approach of only reviewing and penalizing such plays after the game is over is not sufficient in deterring such hits and violates the spirit of the game. The life time health of the players demands extreme action. If the NFL is unable to police itself then Congress must step in with regulation. Right now it appears profits are outweighing safety.</p>

         	<p>Ok, after some fiddling I now have the home page rendering as I want it to on tablets. First I experimented with the viewport setting, but that did not fix the problem. Next, I downloaded the CSS and uploaded a copy to my server. Then, I experimented with the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp">@media</a> setting, landing on auto for the left and right margins and max-device-width to 1024px.</p>

<p>Now the home page renders centered on my iPad Mini, Nexus 9 and iPad Pro. It actually renders the best on the Nexus 9.</p>
