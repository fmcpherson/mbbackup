Consequently, any person in power is going to encounter oppositional power and how that person handles it is an important skill. So, RFK Jr. has some opinions about affects of vaccines on autism, which he is certainly allowed to have, but what will he do with them? How does he view those who disagree with his opinions, with contempt or as an opponent? Too many people treat others with contempt and that is counter productive. \n",

				"title": "First Impressions Of The Google Pixel 7a",
				"content_html": "<p>Google announced and began selling <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7a?hl=en-US\">the Pixel 7a</a> earlier last month, and I ordered a Sea colored version from Amazon about a week later. The Pixel 7a is replacing the Pixel 4a that has been my everyday carry phone for the last three years. I really like the size and feel of the Pixel 4a and so I was not eager to up-size to the newer phone, but it has come to the end of the road with Android and there are features the 7a has that make the upgrade a &ldquo;no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>My main concern about the Pixel 7a has been its size and glossy back. The Pixel 7a is taller than the Pixel 4a and because of that I find it harder to operate with one hand. The weight, however, is the most noticeable difference. I am finding that due to the weight it is more comfortable holding the phone in my left hand, but in a position where I can&rsquo;t scroll apps with that same hand and as a result this phone requires more two hand operation than the Pixel 4a. The weight and size difference is also noticeable when I put the Pixel 7a in a front pant pocket. Fortunately, the size do not make these use cases impossible, just different and I suspect the difference will become less noticeable over time.</p>\n\n<p>The back of the Pixel 7a is more &ldquo;polished&rdquo; than the Pixel 4a, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel so slippery that I fear it is going to quickly slip out of my hand. I purchased a <a href=\"https://latercase.com/products/google-pixel-7a-thin-case?variant=40235135729750\">really nice Latercase</a> that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life appears to be better, but I don&rsquo;t know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. <a href=\"https://accubatteryapp.com/\">Accubattery</a> is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%. Battery life is an item that requires a longer duration to evaluate.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is just me, but I think pictures using the wide angle lens have a bit of a fish eye affect. (See the last picture on <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/20/testing-the-camera.html\">this page</a> for an example.) I don&rsquo;t think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras.</p>\n\n<p>I really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast.</p>\n\n<p>As I expected, it was a real pain to move the Pixel Watch from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/21/googles-tech-ecosystem.html\">Google really does not understand what is a technology ecosystem</a>, it&rsquo;s not just a suite of products that have the same appearance, it&rsquo;s products that work together with little effort by the user. The fact that one has to factory reset a WearOS watch to move it from one Pixel phone to another is the clearest evidence of Google&rsquo;s cluelessness when it comes to tech ecosystems. At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work.</p>\n\n<p>Of the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it&rsquo;s best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery. Seems to me though that Google intends users to keep the phone on the stand, so you would think they would incorporate programming to help with the battery health.</p>\n\n<p>Over all I am happy with the Pixel 7a. It&rsquo;s larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the &ldquo;A Series&rdquo; pixel phones, but it&rsquo;s not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the &ldquo;small, medium, and large&rdquo; sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phone is to get a larger screen. I really hope that Google keeps a phone that is no larger than 6-inches tall.</p>\n",

I purchased a <a href=\"https://latercase.com/products/google-pixel-7a-thin-case?variant=40235135729750\">really nice Latercase</a> that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone.\n\nBattery life appears to be better, but I don't know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. <a href=\"https://accubatteryapp.com/\">Accubattery</a> is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%. Battery life is an item that requires a longer duration to evaluate.\n\nI don't know if it is just me, but I think pictures using the wide angle lens have a bit of a fish eye affect. (See the last picture on <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/20/testing-the-camera.html\">this page</a> for an example.) I don't think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras.\n\nI really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn't seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast.\n\nAs I expected, it was a real pain to move the Pixel Watch from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/21/googles-tech-ecosystem.html\">Google really does not understand what is a technology ecosystem</a>, it's not just a suite of products that have the same appearance, it's products that work together with little effort by the user. The fact that one has to factory reset a WearOS watch to move it from one Pixel phone to another is the clearest evidence of Google's cluelessness when it comes to tech ecosystems. At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work.\n\nOf the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it's best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery. Seems to me though that Google intends users to keep the phone on the stand, so you would think they would incorporate programming to help with the battery health. \n\nOver all I am happy with the Pixel 7a. It's larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the \"A Series\" pixel phones, but it's not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the \"small, medium, and large\" sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the \"flagship\" phone is to get a larger screen. I really hope that Google keeps a phone that is no larger than 6-inches tall.\n",

				"title": "Does screen refresh really matter on smartphones?",
				"content_html": "<p>One of the unwritten rules of tech is the idea that more is better, the purpose of which is to have us continually buy the latest generation of a product. The rule began with the model year releases of automobiles and became adopted by the tech industry. Unfortunately, we consumers don&rsquo;t often enough question whether the latest features really do matter. We aren&rsquo;t helped by tech reviewers who often seem to advocate more for the tech industry than consumers. An example that I am thinking about is the push for faster refresh rates on smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>If you have read smartphone reviews over the last year or so you have probably been convinced that phones with 60Hz refresh screens are bad and really should be avoided. We all should be clamoring for 120Hz or at least 90Hz screens so that we get the fastest, smoothest screen scrolling. Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?</p>\n\n<p>Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited,&rdquo; 60Hz screen as my daily driver. When I got the new Pixel 7a I dutifully changed the setting, as prescribed by nearly all tech reviewers, to turn on Smooth Display so that it displays at 90Hz. Every reviewer who directs one to make this change intones something to the affect, &ldquo;why is Smooth Display not enabled by default?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>While I can say, yes, after turning on Smooth Display scrolling text up/down on the Pixel 7a is faster, what nobody seems to ask is, on a 6-inch display, does one really need that scrolling to be faster? I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not. Increase the size of the screen to perhaps the 11-inch standard tablet, or larger, and I can see how faster refresh can really matter, but on a 6-inch screen?</p>\n\n<p>Another example, at least to me, is the &ldquo;insistence&rdquo; that we all need 5G wireless data on our phones. Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen? For example, I streamed video on the Pixel 7a and it looked no better to me than on the Pixel 4a. Again, if I were on a tablet or certainly a PC then I would likely benefit by the faster transfer rate, but I doubt that 5G is really going to make difference on the Pixel 7a.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair, I do gain some benefits in the upgrade from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. I am finding the front, under-screen finger print scanner is much better than the back scanner of the 4a. The camera is much better and thus I am getting better pictures. Battery life seems to be better, probably thanks to a larger battery and the Tensor G2 chip, and I am happy to finally have the convenience of wireless charging.</p>\n\n<p>Truth is, we likely reached peak smartphone many years ago, therefore there are really fewer needed new features that really matter, and consequently there is a need for more marketing to get people to buy phones. If you are wondering why Google will be selling the Pixel Fold, the reason why is because the smartphone &ldquo;industry&rdquo; is convinced such foldables are needed in order to keep selling phones over the next ten years. (The main case for foldables is people want to carry smaller devices, but ironically that could be served by selling phones with smaller screens!) In my opinion, the only change in smartphones that we really need is in battery life, and the technical problem of gaining more battery life from the same size batteries appears to be impossible to overcome. Ironically, one way to improve battery life is to set the screen refresh to 60Hz and use slower file transfer speeds, but then we could get by with last year&rsquo;s phone.</p>\n",

Unfortunately, we consumers don't often enough question whether the latest features really do matter. We aren't helped by tech reviewers who often seem to advocate more for the tech industry than consumers. An example that I am thinking about is the push for faster refresh rates on smartphones.\n\nIf you have read smartphone reviews over the last year or so you have probably been convinced that phones with 60Hz refresh screens are bad and really should be avoided. We all should be clamoring for 120Hz or at least 90Hz screens so that we get the fastest, smoothest screen scrolling. Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?\n\nUp until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it's \"limited,\" 60Hz screen as my daily driver. When I got the new Pixel 7a I dutifully changed the setting, as prescribed by nearly all tech reviewers, to turn on Smooth Display so that it displays at 90Hz. Every reviewer who directs one to make this change intones something to the affect, \"why is Smooth Display not enabled by default?\"\n\nWhile I can say, yes, after turning on Smooth Display scrolling text up/down on the Pixel 7a is faster, what nobody seems to ask is, on a 6-inch display, does one really need that scrolling to be faster? I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not. Increase the size of the screen to perhaps the 11-inch standard tablet, or larger, and I can see how faster refresh can really matter, but on a 6-inch screen? \n\nAnother example, at least to me, is the \"insistence\" that we all need 5G wireless data on our phones. Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the \"plain\" LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen? For example, I streamed video on the Pixel 7a and it looked no better to me than on the Pixel 4a. Again, if I were on a tablet or certainly a PC then I would likely benefit by the faster transfer rate, but I doubt that 5G is really going to make difference on the Pixel 7a.\n\nTo be fair, I do gain some benefits in the upgrade from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. I am finding the front, under-screen finger print scanner is much better than the back scanner of the 4a. The camera is much better and thus I am getting better pictures. Battery life seems to be better, probably thanks to a larger battery and the Tensor G2 chip, and I am happy to finally have the convenience of wireless charging.\n\nTruth is, we likely reached peak smartphone many years ago, therefore there are really fewer needed new features that really matter, and consequently there is a need for more marketing to get people to buy phones. If you are wondering why Google will be selling the Pixel Fold, the reason why is because the smartphone \"industry\" is convinced such foldables are needed in order to keep selling phones over the next ten years. (The main case for foldables is people want to carry smaller devices, but ironically that could be served by selling phones with smaller screens!) In my opinion, the only change in smartphones that we really need is in battery life, and the technical problem of gaining more battery life from the same size batteries appears to be impossible to overcome. Ironically, one way to improve battery life is to set the screen refresh to 60Hz and use slower file transfer speeds, but then we could get by with last year's phone.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I have now replaced two Pixel phones with a newer model and each time I do I am astounded by how little Google understands technology ecosystems. Not only does Google require physically connecting the two phones together with a cable to transfer data, but to transfer a WearOS watch, like the Pixel Watch, from one phone to another you have to factory reset the watch. Seriously! Does anyone at Google ever even try moving from one generation phone to another?</p>\n\n<p>Google seems to think that when one buys a new Pixel phone they are going to buy a new watch too. The factory reset of the watch would not be so bad if one could restore the watch like one can with a Pixel phone, but Google does not provide a backup of WearOS watches to their cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the process for one who owns a Pixel Watch paired with a Pixel 4a to replace the phone with a Pixel 7a. You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the &ldquo;old&rdquo; phone.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets. Apple has been doing this for many years, and honestly, I do not understand why Google, with all of its technical brilliance cannot figure out how to make this process of transfering from one model Pixel phone to another as pain free as possible.</p>\n\n<p>So, once you have the phone set it comes time to pair the Pixel Watch to the new phone. The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything. Oh, and neither the Google Play store nor the Google Watch app keep track of what apps or watch faces you install on the watch, so you have figure out what to install! Anyone at Google who does such a transfer finds this acceptable ought to be embarrased, it might be the most brain dead process of all of technology!</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like nobody at Google has figured it out. Transferring the Pixel Buds Pro from the Pixel 4a to the 7a works exactly how one expects, and how transferring a watch should work. No reset, no pairing, no manual configuration, just take the buds out of the case, put them in my ear, and they just work on the new phone!</p>\n\n<p>Like the Pixel Buds, the Pixel Watch is an accessory to Pixel Phones, but the WearOS, Android, and Pixel teams seem to think the Pixel Watch is a standalone device. Sure, one can buy a watch with an LTE radio and with it and the built-in GPS the watch can function apart from the phone, but honestly, most users are not buying watches with LTE radios. Even if they do, the process of using the Play Store app on the watch to find and install apps is best described as tedious.</p>\n\n<p>The worst part of the WearOS apps process is that Google actually had it right the first time it released their smartwatch operating system. When Google first released a smartwatch there was no way to install apps directly on the watch, you had to use the phone, and the companion app on the phone made it easy to manage the apps to install.

On the other hand, the idea that anyone running for U.S. President is shielded from being put on trial does not seem right either as that means when one feels they are at risk they will simply declare their candidacy. I strongly suspect this is the reason why Trump declared he is running for President. \r\n\r\nAll of this reinforces how broken is the United States. \n",

The intent of the page is simply sharing what one is doing. <a href=\"https://nownownow.com/\">The idea caught on</a> and today many sites, some more current than others, have a now page.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to create and maintain my /now page using Dave Winer&rsquo;s Little Outliner because I felt it was a good editor for this type of writing, and it worked particularly well with another piece of software by Dave called pagePark. <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/pagePark\">PagePark</a> is a HTTP server that renders the OPML files that Little Outliner creates into HTML. Dave hosts an instance of pagePark that is integrated with Little Outliner such that as soon as an outline is saved, <a href=\"http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml\">the HTML version of that outline</a> is nearly instantly available. Consequently, the process of editing and publishing changes to my /now page was as simple and quick as loading Little Outliner and writing. Low friction increases the possibility of keeping the page current.</p>\n\n<p>Connecting my /now page to my blog was straightforward because the hosting provider makes it easy to create pages that redirect to other pages. Therefore, when you type <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/now\">https://frankmcpherson.blog/now</a> you end up at my /now page. I took the idea of the page redirect off my blog a step further by purchasing a domain, frankm.info, that I configured to forward to the site. If anyone asked me online, what am I doing, I can tell them to simply go to <a href=\"http://frankm.info\">frankm.info</a> to find out.</p>\n\n<p>Over time I expanded beyond the single /now page to add pages that listed <a href=\"http://tech.frankm.info\">the technology that I use</a> and the <a href=\"http://2022books.frankm.info\">books that I have read</a>, each with their own alias URL. Using a forwarding URL enables me to move the actual location of the files, update the forwarding destination in DNS, and instances of the alias URL that I have in my writing will point to the current location.</p>\n\n<p>Since the time that I set all this up using Little Outliner, Dave created a new &ldquo;version&rdquo; of it called <a href=\"https://drummer.land\">Drummer</a>. I&rsquo;ve used Drummer since its beginning and always knew that it would some day replace Little Outliner. I didn&rsquo;t move my informational outlines to Drummer until recently when Twitter made changes to its API that Dave has been using for user identity management and login. Dave announced he would be updating Drummer with a new login process and also move access of it to HTTPS. He stated he did not intend to make changes to Little Outliner, and advised anyone using it to move to Drummer as soon as possible, and at that time I migrated my files over so that I can edit them in Drummer, and I updated the alias URLs accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Dave had to make the changes quickly because Twitter had not stated a clear deadline by which it would cut off access to its API, and that means prioritizing what he works on first. For example, the blogging capability Drummer provides currently does not work. I am sure that capability will be restored, and Dave will get to it when he gets to it. The &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; of OPML files via an instance of pagePark is also lower on the list. Consequently, I started thinking about what I can do to restore my ability to publish updates to my /now page.</p>\n\n<p>One option was to stop using Drummer to edit these pages, but that would create a lot of work moving the content and formattting it. The option that I took was to build my own instance of pagePark. First I tried using <a href=\"https://pagepark.onrender.com\">an instance of pagePark</a> that I built under a free account at <a href=\"https://render.com\">Render</a>. Render only allows HTTPS access and the free account takes the site offline after 30 minutes. When you request the site, it&rsquo;s brought online but there is a noticable delay. Consequently, I built a new virtual machine using free resources provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve updated <a href=\"http://projects.frankm.info\">my projects outline</a> with the details about how I set this up, it was pretty straightforward after I figured out how to get around firewall issues.

It treated its employees more like people and less like human resources, giving them chances to learn and succeed along with the company. “I’m a great believer that in any team,” he told me, “any member is better at something than somebody else, so to get the team to perform you want everyone to perform on their best axis. Teams that work well together work better.” He emphasized the importance of being honest with employees and not overpromising what the company had to offer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above resonates with me because the company I hired in to out of college, Electronic Data Systems, had the same business model, treat employees in a similar manner, and had success. Unlike ARM, EDS went through several different owners (GM, HP, HPE, CSC/DXC) and CEOs and each change moved further from the founding vision to the point at which it no-longer really exists.</p>\n\n<p>The story also calls to mind <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780735213524\">The Infinite Game</a> by Steve Sinek. Using Reimer&rsquo;s comparison of ARM and Commodore, ARM was playing the infinite game, Commodore the finite game. In the book Sinek describes the reletively few businesses playing the &ldquo;infinite game&rdquo; versus the vast majority playing the &ldquo;finite&rdquo; game. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Infinite games have infinite time horizons. And because there is no finish line, no practical end to the game, there is no such thing as “winning” an infinite game. In an infinite game, the primary objective is to keep playing, to perpetuate the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having been hired by EDS and surviving through the multitude of transitions that has occurred, I have seen first hand the differences a building a company, which usually has a founder, and buying a company, which usually has a manager. In most cases bought companies are separated from their founding, has no leadership and thus no culture.</p>\n\n<p>It amazes me that given all the evidence of how to achieve long term success, such as ARM&rsquo;s, that so few U.S. companies are interested in the infinite game. The finite game rules business, thus it rules capitalism, and given relationship of capitalism to the United States, the finite game rules the U.S. I don&rsquo;t think prospects will change in the United States until we find leaders who are builders, right now our political, economic, and religions cultures appear to all be playing the finite game.</p>\n",

When they can't find the function, they ask where it is, and if they are told that it doesn't exist it seems they then start to complain or at least doubt the reasons for why the function doesn't exist with the alternate application.\n\nIn my opinion, the idea that every application should work exactly the same is problematic. Micro.blog was created specifically to not be Twitter and Mastodon was created specifically to not be Twitter, and the value of these applications are that they are not Twitter!\n\nAnd you know what, it's ok! Life can exist without a \"like\" button and it can exist without a quote \"tweet.\"  We don't need to change the minds of those who disagree, we just need to figure out how to co-exist. \n",

The Constitution does not exist to define the rights of citizens and **I am pretty sure Madison did not imagine that the Bill of Rights defined the only rights of U.S. citizens.** Therefore it seems to me that the very act of removing rights from citizens through declaring that SCOTUS decisions granted rights not provided for in the Constitution is the exact opposite of an originalist understanding of the Constitution. Roe v. Wade restrains the Federal government from taking a women's right of autonomy over their own body, a right by the way that many of been claiming is the reason why things like \"mask mandates\" and \"vaccine mandates' are not constitutional. \n",

I am one of those people who sleeps with their phone on their bed stand, it's basically my alarm clock. In the past, when in the dark always on display would dim but stay on enough to be seen and I woke up I could see the time. For the last several nights now the display has turned off and I don't know why. I see that Digital Wellbeing has a bedtime mode where I can specify keep the screen dark, but I am not using that function. \n",

When Google released the Pixel 2 I frankly couldn&rsquo;t switch fast enough because it was 5.74 inches tall and a little skinnier at 2.74 inches wide. The Pixel 4a I now carry has the same physical size with a larger screen that I find perfect. Sadly, the Pixel 5a is now the smallest Google phone at 6.1 inches and the new Pixel 6 is at 6.2 inches. I have never carried a phone as large as the new Pixel 6 Pro that is 6.5 inches tall. I fear we may never see a sub 6 inch Pixel phone again, but at least the larger phones have larger batteries.</p>\n",

The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are priced very favorably and is going to put to test the question of whether a well designed Android phone can seriously compete with the iPhone.

Hosting of the front end Editor and backed publisher and web content is currently being provided by Dave Winer, who is the application developer.\n\nOne can associate a unique URL to the location where the generated blog content is stored using [PagePark](http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/10/11/135025.html?title=pageparkBuildsAgain). In this instance PagePark is basically acting as a reverse proxy, none of your content is stored on your own server.\n\nDave does provide Mac version of the Drummer front end that is based on Electron. He may provide Windows and Linux versions of the app. The Electron version of the app will enable you to store and edit your source content OPML files on your own computer, but from what I can tell the published content will still be hosted on Dave's server.\n\nFrom what I have read, the desktop version of Drummer is intended to be near to or equal to the OPML Editor. For my purposes it is most desirable to have the desktop version of this application.\n\nFinal note, a check of the source to the HTML file of the blog shows that nearly all of the \"script src\" tags have been changed and it looks like if one hosts PagePark on a server/container that supports HTTPS you might have success in accessing the blog via HTTPs. \n\nMy Drummer blog is at [oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/.](http://oldschool.scripting.com/frankm/.) \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Back when there were several book store chains and plenty of stores I spent a fair amount of time in them and in particular looking through the computer magazine section. Magazines were a big part of my formative computing years, and I looked forward to each month&rsquo;s issue of <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine\">Byte</a>. The magazines were not only a source of news about the latest hardware and software, they were also a means of software distribution containing pages of source code available to manually enter on a variety of computer platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Physical book stores are nearly extinct and computer magazines shrank in to oblivion, replaced by the Internet, but I have found one corner of the Internet where computer magazines still live. You may have heard of the Raspberry Pi, which is an inexpensive &ldquo;computer on a chip&rdquo;  popular amongst makers. What you might not know is that raspberrypi.org is more than just the computer hardware, it&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/\">foundation dedicated towards computer education</a>. The foundation publishes tutorials and lesson plans for teachers and it has a publishing arm for books and magazines.</p>\n\n<p>Four different magazines are <a href=\"https://store.rpipress.cc\">published</a>: HackSpace, Custom PC, Wireframe, and The MagPi, which you can subscribe to and purchase online and in stores in the United Kingdom. Better yet, the magazines and books are free to download in PDF format.</p>\n\n<p>If you own a Raspberry Pi and have the full desktop version of the operating system installed you will find a Bookshelf app in the Help menu of the desktop&rsquo;s application launcher. Bookshelf has tabs for each magazine and books that you can download and read on the Pi.

				"content_text": "Back when there were several book store chains and plenty of stores I spent a fair amount of time in them and in particular looking through the computer magazine section. Magazines were a big part of my formative computing years, and I looked forward to each month's issue of [Byte](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine). The magazines were not only a source of news about the latest hardware and software, they were also a means of software distribution containing pages of source code available to manually enter on a variety of computer platforms. \n\nPhysical book stores are nearly extinct and computer magazines shrank in to oblivion, replaced by the Internet, but I have found one corner of the Internet where computer magazines still live. You may have heard of the Raspberry Pi, which is an inexpensive \"computer on a chip\"  popular amongst makers. What you might not know is that raspberrypi.org is more than just the computer hardware, it's a [foundation dedicated towards computer education](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/). The foundation publishes tutorials and lesson plans for teachers and it has a publishing arm for books and magazines. \n\nFour different magazines are [published](https://store.rpipress.cc): HackSpace, Custom PC, Wireframe, and The MagPi, which you can subscribe to and purchase online and in stores in the United Kingdom. Better yet, the magazines and books are free to download in PDF format. \n\nIf you own a Raspberry Pi and have the full desktop version of the operating system installed you will find a Bookshelf app in the Help menu of the desktop's application launcher. Bookshelf has tabs for each magazine and books that you can download and read on the Pi.  If you don't have a Pi you can [browse through and download the PDFS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/books-magazines/) using the web browser on your computer.\n\nIf you are not familiar with Raspberry Pi you will find everything you need to know about it on their web site, [raspberrypi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).  Another great source for information is the [Official Raspberry Pi Handbook](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/books/handbook-2022), and the 2022 version has been just released and available to download. \n\nIf you are looking for an inexpensive starter computer for yourself or a child, I recommend [the Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-400-the-70-desktop-pc/), which is an \"all-in-one\" computer you can buy for $70.

I am most interested in Window 11 because Windows is the primary operating system that I use every work day, but <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/11/how-universal-control-on-ipados-15-and-macos-12-works\">the integrations</a> between iPadOS and MacOS also have me interested in a Mac. If I buy a Mac I can also <a href=\"https://www.parallels.com/blogs/windows11/\">run Windows 11 in a VM</a>, so that will provide me the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p>So, I watched the Microsoft Event today to see whether Microsoft might announce something that will influence my purchase decision. My conclusion is none of the products announced today fit in the budget that I have in mind because of the add-ons one has to purchase to gain full functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did announce nice looking products today, but for me they have a real pricing problem. Take, for example, the new Surface Go 3. The lowest price version costs $399, which comes with 4 GB of RAM and only 64 GB of storage, which I really do not think is enough storage for any productivity device in 2021. Consequently, the lowest model I would consider is the mid-tier 8 GB RAM, 128 GB model at $549, but that only gets you the tablet. You will want to add a type cover that costs at least $100 and most likely a Surface Pen for another $70, for a grand total of $719, and that combo is with an Intel Pentium processor rather than the more powerful Intel Core i5 in the Surface Laptop Go. In my opinion Microsoft should include the type keyboard with the Surface Pro and Surface Go at their current price.</p>\n\n<p>My research prior to the event tells me that the Microsoft product that most makes sense for a reasonable PC running Windows 11 is the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-go/94fc0bdgq7wv?activetab=pivot:overviewtab\">Surface Laptop Go</a>. While it won&rsquo;t run MacOS, you can buy a well equipped model (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) for $800.</p>\n\n<p>Thing is, I can also buy a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/\">Mac Mini</a> with the same memory, storage, and price and for less than $200 also have the ability to run Windows 11. Of course, the Mini is a desktop and my bias is toward the portability of a laptop, so that has me looking at a Macbook Air for $200 more, which is pushing the price a bit higher than I would like.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t intend to make a decision until after the expected Apple Mac event that should happen in October. Rumors are a new Mac Mini and Macbook Pros will be announced, but not an Air. A new Macbook Pro might influence pricing of the current Airs. My ideal would be a new entry level Pro with 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSD starting at the current $1299 &ldquo;base&rdquo; price, which I think would mean Apple could drop the price of the current Airs by $100 to $200. The logic being it would not make sense to have the high end Air and the Low end Pro with the same specs and same price because nobody would by the high end Air. (The only reason to buy the high end Air over the Pro right now is the 512 GB storage at $50 less price!)</p>\n\n<p>The other question is, what will be the specs for the new Mac Minis? In this case I expect the specs will remain the same, the prices will remain the same, and there will be a processor upgrade. However, the consequence there might be availability of the current Mac Minis at lower prices. An 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD model at nearly $600 is appealing.</p>\n\n<p>One might think the reasoning I&rsquo;ve described above is an &ldquo;apples to oranges&rdquo; comparison. I see it as a &ldquo;get what I need&rdquo; versus an &ldquo;investment&rdquo; comparison. I bought my last Macbook Air 15 years ago, and it still functions! It&rsquo;s really slow compared to most devices today, but what that experience tells me is that buying an Apple laptop or desktop realistically gets me 5 to 7 years of use. I can buy a cheaper laptop to just run Windows 11 but it probably gets me 4 years of real use.</p>\n\n<p>So, now we wait for the next Apple event.

				"content_html": "<p>What made local area and wireless networks happen are industry standards that enable different vendor products to work with each other. The Internet Of Things is nearly the exact opposite, in my home is a case in point. I have Hue lights that require a Hue hub for management and I have a number of sensors and smart switches that use Zigbee that I manage with Samsung&rsquo;s SmartThings hub.</p>\n\n<p>The SmartThings hub can control the Hue lights, but the Hue hub only knows Hue products. I started first with the Hue lights and the hub, but if I had could have seen in the future I might have just bought the SmartThings hub. On the other hand, one big thing I get with the Hue hub is the use of a catalog of scenes that combine different colors to make for some pretty nice lighting in our basement.</p>\n\n<p>I recently bought two cheaper Sylvania color smartlights when recent heavy rains suggested it might be nice to have a color smartlight in our living room, right now we have a non-color Hue light in the living room. We have a moisture sensor in the sump pump pit that works with the SmartThings hub and an automation in SmartThings that turns on all of the lights when moisture is detected. The automation sets the color lights to purple (homage to Prince) but obviously cannot do that with non-color lights. It happened the automation was recently triggered during the evening when the living room light might normally come on so I realize it just turning on might not be enough notification. Thus the idea to buy a color light, thus the purpose of the Sylvania light because the Hue light costs $50.</p>\n\n<p>Before putting the new Sylvania light in the living room I decided to test it in the basement, where I have the color Hue lights, and here exposes the problem. The Hue lights are controlled by the Hue hub that knows nothing about the Sylvania light, this the Sylvania light cannot be part of the any of the Hue scenes. Perhaps I can find a &ldquo;third party&rdquo; app that works with SmartThings to replace Hue scenes, but I have not yet done the research.</p>\n\n<p>Better, yet, would be an industry standard for controlling these color lights that would enable me to fully control them, with scenes, from one hub or &ldquo;smart device.&rdquo; Of course, this is a known problem and industy leaders appear to be working together to address it by developing <a href=\"https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/\">a protocol called Matter</a>. Hopefully, there will be a day when all I need is one controlling device, technically right now I have three: Hue hub, SmartThings hub, Amazon Echo, and Google Home.</p>\n\n<p>P.S. I really hope the Matter protocol addresses how smartlights handle resumption of power after a power outage. Hue added the ability to enforce the last known state, if a light was off when the power went off then it is supposed to stay off when power is restored. However, I&rsquo;ve found that doesn&rsquo;t work well with multiple successive short power loses. Worse, is the fact that the Sylvania light appears to not have such a setting. When power is restored the light turns on, regardless of its prior state.</p>\n",

On the other hand, one big thing I get with the Hue hub is the use of a catalog of scenes that combine different colors to make for some pretty nice lighting in our basement.\n\nI recently bought two cheaper Sylvania color smartlights when recent heavy rains suggested it might be nice to have a color smartlight in our living room, right now we have a non-color Hue light in the living room. We have a moisture sensor in the sump pump pit that works with the SmartThings hub and an automation in SmartThings that turns on all of the lights when moisture is detected. The automation sets the color lights to purple (homage to Prince) but obviously cannot do that with non-color lights. It happened the automation was recently triggered during the evening when the living room light might normally come on so I realize it just turning on might not be enough notification. Thus the idea to buy a color light, thus the purpose of the Sylvania light because the Hue light costs $50. \n\nBefore putting the new Sylvania light in the living room I decided to test it in the basement, where I have the color Hue lights, and here exposes the problem. The Hue lights are controlled by the Hue hub that knows nothing about the Sylvania light, this the Sylvania light cannot be part of the any of the Hue scenes. Perhaps I can find a \"third party\" app that works with SmartThings to replace Hue scenes, but I have not yet done the research. \n\nBetter, yet, would be an industry standard for controlling these color lights that would enable me to fully control them, with scenes, from one hub or \"smart device.\" Of course, this is a known problem and industy leaders appear to be working together to address it by developing [a protocol called Matter](https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/). Hopefully, there will be a day when all I need is one controlling device, technically right now I have three: Hue hub, SmartThings hub, Amazon Echo, and Google Home.\n\nP.S. I really hope the Matter protocol addresses how smartlights handle resumption of power after a power outage. Hue added the ability to enforce the last known state, if a light was off when the power went off then it is supposed to stay off when power is restored. However, I've found that doesn't work well with multiple successive short power loses. Worse, is the fact that the Sylvania light appears to not have such a setting. When power is restored the light turns on, regardless of its prior state. \n",

A stream is ephemeral, it continues to move over time and one mostly adds to it and watches it flow away. On the Internet a stream is content for only right now, and usually isn&rsquo;t edited nor looked at years later. Streams are date and time driven. Stream platforms are optimized for quick and easy entry of new content.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, and blogs are examples of platforms used for publishing streams of content. Note that this is not absolute, for example one can and might edit a blog post they wrote a year ago in which case that blog might well be a garden.</p>\n\n<p>The garden metaphor, in contrast, is more permanent. The content in a garden is continually edited to reflect new ideas or new learning over a period of time. A garden is organized around a topic. Platforms for creating and maintaining gardens are optimized for editing and linking together of content. Connecting the dots (linking) between content can generate new ideas or thoughts. Wiki is an example of a garden platform, as is the web itself as originally intended, as are other tools optimized for linking together and organizing content.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of other interesting differences exist between the two from a user and platform provider perspective. Almost all streams are public, their very point is public sharing, and the platform providers freely provide their platforms and make their money my manipulating the presentation of what one puts in to the stream to others.

Platform providers either freely provide their platform as open source for users to install in their own computers or they make money by hosting their platforms and charging uses for renting space on their hosting. The key point being the garden platform providers do not make money on the content. In my opinion, a site that has the purpose of making money from content is something other than a garden, so for example, I do not think of Medium as a garden, nor are other sites like The Verge or Engadget that may publish using a blogging or content management system.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> USB-C Docks that include USB 3 data ports most likely do not support DisplayPort 4K at 60 Hz unless they support DisplayPort 1.4. A dock with a DisplayPort port and USB 2.1 probably can do 4K@60Hz.</p>\n\n<p>I recently bought a <a href=\"https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html\">BenQ 4K monitor</a> and when I connected it to the USB-C dock that I had I found out that the dock could only support 4K at 30HZ, which is noticeably slow just when moving the mouse on the screen. Just about all the computer monitors we use support 60 Hz refresh rates.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I was using my Pixelbook with the dock and I found that when I connect it to the monitor using a USB-C cable it can do 4K@60Hz, so I figured the dock was the limiting factor, which I confirmed on the manufacture&rsquo;s web site. I then started to search for docks that say they can do 4K@60Hz and decided on the <a href=\"https://us.anker.com/products/a8392\">Anker PowerExpander</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As you probably imagine by now, I got the new dock yesterday and found it also is only doing 4K@30Hz, on the HDMI and DisplayPorts. Sigh. I tested the dock with another computer and it does 4K@60Hz, so I am back looking at the Pixelbook.</p>\n\n<p>I have since learned from <a href=\"https://www.bigmessowires.com/2019/05/19/explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub/\">this article</a> that the problem is that USB-C docks need to support data transfer as well as display and that decreases the number of lanes that are available for display at high refresh rates to two, whereas 4K@60Hz needs all four lanes. When you connect the Pixelbook to a monitor with a USB-C cable it can use all four of the cable&rsquo;s communication lanes to enable it to handle 4K@60Hz.</p>\n\n<p>Anker&rsquo;s site says 4K on DisplayPort requires DisplayPort 1.4 and I have found that the Pixelbook only supports DisplayPort 1.2. As the article I found explains, DisplayPort 1.4 only needs two lanes for 4K@60Hz because it has an additional high bit rate mode and compression, which is why the Anker hub I have can do 4K@60Hz while also providing USB 3.1 data transfers. The problem is that the computer, hub, and monitor all need to support DisplayPort 1.4 for this all to work, and the Pixelbook does not.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson from this experience is that connecting to high resolution monitors at high refresh rates via a hub is more complicated than simply using a cable because it requires understanding the technical capabilities of the computer, hub, and monitor. You may have to dig to find out whether a computer, and a Chromebook in particular, supports DisplayPort 1.4. Thunderbolt 3 also supports 4K@60Hz and fast data transfers but is not yet available in Chromebooks and Thunderbolt 3 docks are more expensive than USB-C docks.</p>\n\n<p>I think my experience that I&rsquo;ve written about here explains why <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/chromebook-docking-stations/\">Google recently announced</a> the addition of docks to their &ldquo;Works With Chromebook&rdquo; program. If Google were to announced a new Pixelbook this summer that had DisplayPort 1.4 support (or Thunderbolt 3) it would be helpful to know exactly which Docks can do 4K@60Hz.</p>\n\n<p>As for my current situation, even though this new Anker dock cannot provide 4K@60Hz with my Pixelbook, it has more display ports to drive multiple monitors and has more data ports than the hub it replaced, so I still have an upgrade over the dock I was using previously. However, had I known what I now know prior to purchasing this Anker dock, I probably would have bought <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B06Y5N3YCD/?tag=runworks-20\">this Cable Matters dock</a> instead as I could live with USB 2.1. For now I using the slightly lower 2560 x 1600 resolution at 60Hz rather than 4K, but if I really want 4K I can connect directly to the monitor via one USB-C port and use the dock on the other for power and the additional ports.</p>\n",
