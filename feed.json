If I buy a Mac I can also <a href=\"https://www.parallels.com/blogs/windows11/\">run Windows 11 in a VM</a>, so that will provide me the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p>So, I watched the Microsoft Event today to see whether Microsoft might announce something that will influence my purchase decision. My conclusion is none of the products announced today fit in the budget that I have in mind because of the add-ons one has to purchase to gain full functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft did announce nice looking products today, but for me they have a real pricing problem. Take, for example, the new Surface Go 3. The lowest price version costs $399, which comes with 4 GB of RAM and only 64 GB of storage, which I really do not think is enough storage for any productivity device in 2021. Consequently, the lowest model I would consider is the mid-tier 8 GB RAM, 128 GB model at $549, but that only gets you the tablet. You will want to add a type cover that costs at least $100 and most likely a Surface Pen for another $70, for a grand total of $719, and that combo is with an Intel Pentium processor rather than the more powerful Intel Core i5 in the Surface Laptop Go. In my opinion Microsoft should include the type keyboard with the Surface Pro and Surface Go at their current price.</p>\n\n<p>My research prior to the event tells me that the Microsoft product that most makes sense for a reasonable PC running Windows 11 is the <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-go/94fc0bdgq7wv?activetab=pivot:overviewtab\">Surface Laptop Go</a>. While it won&rsquo;t run MacOS, you can buy a well equipped model (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD) for $800.</p>\n\n<p>Thing is, I can also buy a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/\">Mac Mini</a> with the same memory, storage, and price and for less than $200 also have the ability to run Windows 11. Of course, the Mini is a desktop and my bias is toward the portability of a laptop, so that has me looking at a Macbook Air for $200 more, which is pushing the price a bit higher than I would like.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I don&rsquo;t intend to make a decision until after the expected Apple Mac event that should happen in October. Rumors are a new Mac Mini and Macbook Pros will be announced, but not an Air. A new Macbook Pro might influence pricing of the current Airs. My ideal would be a new entry level Pro with 8 GB of RAM and 512 GB SSD starting at the current $1299 &ldquo;base&rdquo; price, which I think would mean Apple could drop the price of the current Airs by $100 to $200. The logic being it would not make sense to have the high end Air and the Low end Pro with the same specs and same price because nobody would by the high end Air. (The only reason to buy the high end Air over the Pro right now is the 512 GB storage at $50 less price!)</p>\n\n<p>The other question is, what will be the specs for the new Mac Minis? In this case I expect the specs will remain the same, the prices will remain the same, and there will be a processor upgrade. However, the consequence there might be availability of the current Mac Minis at lower prices. An 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD model at nearly $600 is appealing.</p>\n\n<p>One might think the reasoning I&rsquo;ve described above is an &ldquo;apples to oranges&rdquo; comparison. I see it as a &ldquo;get what I need&rdquo; versus an &ldquo;investment&rdquo; comparison. I bought my last Macbook Air 15 years ago, and it still functions! It&rsquo;s really slow compared to most devices today, but what that experience tells me is that buying an Apple laptop or desktop realistically gets me 5 to 7 years of use. I can buy a cheaper laptop to just run Windows 11 but it probably gets me 4 years of real use.</p>\n\n<p>So, now we wait for the next Apple event.

				"title": "After Using Android 12 For One Week",
				"content_html": "<p>A little over a week ago I installed <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes\">beta 4</a> of Android 12 on my Google Pixel 4a. I have not experienced any significant issues with running this version of Android, even though it is still a true beta and not a release candidate.</p>\n\n<p>Like most men, I imagine, I carry my phone in my front pants pocket. In the past I occasionally discovered that <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-on-flashlight-on-android\">the flashlight feature</a> of the phone turned on while the phone is in my pocket, causing an odd, if not humorous, appearance. After installing Android 12 I found this occurring much too frequently.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7443425?hl=en\">Two lock screen settings</a> appear to be the culprits: Tap to check phone and lift to check phone. Movement while walking is being interpreted by Android as either a tap or a lift, so I have disabled both features. I notice that Android seems to be smart enough to know the phone is in my pocket because it turns off the ambient display, so it should also disable the tap and lift to check functions, and I have provided feedback on this to Google.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/689828/how-to-disable-or-enable-app-suggestions-on-a-pixel/\">App suggestions</a>, which many people do not like and probably disable, are not working. Google added this feature in Android 11 that changes which app icons appear in the dock at the bottom of the home screen and at the top of the app drawer with the ones most commonly used at a particular time of day. Right now the icons displaying are the ones that were present in the dock at the time I installed the upgrade and have never been changed by Android. I might be the only person who likes this feature enough to report it not working.</p>\n\n<p>I like the changes to the UI that Google has made, particularly increasing the font size in settings.

				"content_text": "A little over a week ago I installed [beta 4](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes) of Android 12 on my Google Pixel 4a. I have not experienced any significant issues with running this version of Android, even though it is still a true beta and not a release candidate. \n\nLike most men, I imagine, I carry my phone in my front pants pocket. In the past I occasionally discovered that [the flashlight feature](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-turn-on-flashlight-on-android) of the phone turned on while the phone is in my pocket, causing an odd, if not humorous, appearance. After installing Android 12 I found this occurring much too frequently.\n\n[Two lock screen settings](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7443425?hl=en) appear to be the culprits: Tap to check phone and lift to check phone. Movement while walking is being interpreted by Android as either a tap or a lift, so I have disabled both features. I notice that Android seems to be smart enough to know the phone is in my pocket because it turns off the ambient display, so it should also disable the tap and lift to check functions, and I have provided feedback on this to Google. \n\n[App suggestions](https://www.howtogeek.com/689828/how-to-disable-or-enable-app-suggestions-on-a-pixel/), which many people do not like and probably disable, are not working. Google added this feature in Android 11 that changes which app icons appear in the dock at the bottom of the home screen and at the top of the app drawer with the ones most commonly used at a particular time of day. Right now the icons displaying are the ones that were present in the dock at the time I installed the upgrade and have never been changed by Android. I might be the only person who likes this feature enough to report it not working.\n\nI like the changes to the UI that Google has made, particularly increasing the font size in settings. The changes to the notifications are nice, although I am not sure whether I am a fan of the increased size of the Quick Settings icons, I think I wish they were the same as in Android 11. \n\nOf course, the big change in Android 12 is the new design language called [Material You](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) with includes automatically changing the overall color appearance to the wallpaper on the phone. I have the Landscapes wallpaper changing daily to see changes with the appearance of the phone, and I am pretty pleased with what I am seeing.\n\nI have not noticed any significant difference with over all performance or battery life, which is good. Ideally we would get better battery life in each release, but at the least we don't want to lose battery life. \nBeta 4 marks Android 12 reaching the platform stability phase, which marks it as feature and API complete so that developers can test against a reliable version. One more release, release candidate one, will be made available before the final release of Android 12. \n\nAndroid 11 was released on September 8, 2020, if Google is to meet that same early September release date we should see the release candidate late next week, which might coincide with the launch of the Pixel 5a. \n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2021/06/18.html#a183936\">Dave</a>, in the context of the Internet, the garden and the stream are metaphors for two different approaches to content on the Internet. A stream is ephemeral, it continues to move over time and one mostly adds to it and watches it flow away. On the Internet a stream is content for only right now, and usually isn&rsquo;t edited nor looked at years later. Streams are date and time driven. Stream platforms are optimized for quick and easy entry of new content.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, and blogs are examples of platforms used for publishing streams of content. Note that this is not absolute, for example one can and might edit a blog post they wrote a year ago in which case that blog might well be a garden.</p>\n\n<p>The garden metaphor, in contrast, is more permanent. The content in a garden is continually edited to reflect new ideas or new learning over a period of time. A garden is organized around a topic. Platforms for creating and maintaining gardens are optimized for editing and linking together of content. Connecting the dots (linking) between content can generate new ideas or thoughts. Wiki is an example of a garden platform, as is the web itself as originally intended, as are other tools optimized for linking together and organizing content.</p>\n\n<p>A couple of other interesting differences exist between the two from a user and platform provider perspective. Almost all streams are public, their very point is public sharing, and the platform providers freely provide their platforms and make their money my manipulating the presentation of what one puts in to the stream to others. Users have little to no control over who sees what they put in to the stream.</p>\n\n<p>Gardens are either public or private, thus users tend to have more control over who and how one sees their content. Platform providers either freely provide their platform as open source for users to install in their own computers or they make money by hosting their platforms and charging uses for renting space on their hosting. The key point being the garden platform providers do not make money on the content. In my opinion, a site that has the purpose of making money from content is something other than a garden, so for example, I do not think of Medium as a garden, nor are other sites like The Verge or Engadget that may publish using a blogging or content management system.</p>\n",

Note that this is not absolute, for example one can and might edit a blog post they wrote a year ago in which case that blog might well be a garden. \n\nThe garden metaphor, in contrast, is more permanent. The content in a garden is continually edited to reflect new ideas or new learning over a period of time. A garden is organized around a topic. Platforms for creating and maintaining gardens are optimized for editing and linking together of content. Connecting the dots (linking) between content can generate new ideas or thoughts. Wiki is an example of a garden platform, as is the web itself as originally intended, as are other tools optimized for linking together and organizing content. \n\nA couple of other interesting differences exist between the two from a user and platform provider perspective. Almost all streams are public, their very point is public sharing, and the platform providers freely provide their platforms and make their money my manipulating the presentation of what one puts in to the stream to others. Users have little to no control over who sees what they put in to the stream. \n\nGardens are either public or private, thus users tend to have more control over who and how one sees their content. Platform providers either freely provide their platform as open source for users to install in their own computers or they make money by hosting their platforms and charging uses for renting space on their hosting. The key point being the garden platform providers do not make money on the content. In my opinion, a site that has the purpose of making money from content is something other than a garden, so for example, I do not think of Medium as a garden, nor are other sites like The Verge or Engadget that may publish using a blogging or content management system. \n",

				"title": "Seeking USB-C Dock For 4K Monitor",
				"content_html": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> USB-C Docks that include USB 3 data ports most likely do not support DisplayPort 4K at 60 Hz unless they support DisplayPort 1.4. A dock with a DisplayPort port and USB 2.1 probably can do 4K@60Hz.</p>\n\n<p>I recently bought a <a href=\"https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html\">BenQ 4K monitor</a> and when I connected it to the USB-C dock that I had I found out that the dock could only support 4K at 30HZ, which is noticeably slow just when moving the mouse on the screen. Just about all the computer monitors we use support 60 Hz refresh rates.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I was using my Pixelbook with the dock and I found that when I connect it to the monitor using a USB-C cable it can do 4K@60Hz, so I figured the dock was the limiting factor, which I confirmed on the manufacture&rsquo;s web site. I then started to search for docks that say they can do 4K@60Hz and decided on the <a href=\"https://us.anker.com/products/a8392\">Anker PowerExpander</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As you probably imagine by now, I got the new dock yesterday and found it also is only doing 4K@30Hz, on the HDMI and DisplayPorts. Sigh. I tested the dock with another computer and it does 4K@60Hz, so I am back looking at the Pixelbook.</p>\n\n<p>I have since learned from <a href=\"https://www.bigmessowires.com/2019/05/19/explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub/\">this article</a> that the problem is that USB-C docks need to support data transfer as well as display and that decreases the number of lanes that are available for display at high refresh rates to two, whereas 4K@60Hz needs all four lanes. When you connect the Pixelbook to a monitor with a USB-C cable it can use all four of the cable&rsquo;s communication lanes to enable it to handle 4K@60Hz.</p>\n\n<p>Anker&rsquo;s site says 4K on DisplayPort requires DisplayPort 1.4 and I have found that the Pixelbook only supports DisplayPort 1.2. As the article I found explains, DisplayPort 1.4 only needs two lanes for 4K@60Hz because it has an additional high bit rate mode and compression, which is why the Anker hub I have can do 4K@60Hz while also providing USB 3.1 data transfers. The problem is that the computer, hub, and monitor all need to support DisplayPort 1.4 for this all to work, and the Pixelbook does not.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson from this experience is that connecting to high resolution monitors at high refresh rates via a hub is more complicated than simply using a cable because it requires understanding the technical capabilities of the computer, hub, and monitor. You may have to dig to find out whether a computer, and a Chromebook in particular, supports DisplayPort 1.4. Thunderbolt 3 also supports 4K@60Hz and fast data transfers but is not yet available in Chromebooks and Thunderbolt 3 docks are more expensive than USB-C docks.</p>\n\n<p>I think my experience that I&rsquo;ve written about here explains why <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/chromebook-docking-stations/\">Google recently announced</a> the addition of docks to their &ldquo;Works With Chromebook&rdquo; program. If Google were to announced a new Pixelbook this summer that had DisplayPort 1.4 support (or Thunderbolt 3) it would be helpful to know exactly which Docks can do 4K@60Hz.</p>\n\n<p>As for my current situation, even though this new Anker dock cannot provide 4K@60Hz with my Pixelbook, it has more display ports to drive multiple monitors and has more data ports than the hub it replaced, so I still have an upgrade over the dock I was using previously. However, had I known what I now know prior to purchasing this Anker dock, I probably would have bought <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B06Y5N3YCD/?tag=runworks-20\">this Cable Matters dock</a> instead as I could live with USB 2.1. For now I using the slightly lower 2560 x 1600 resolution at 60Hz rather than 4K, but if I really want 4K I can connect directly to the monitor via one USB-C port and use the dock on the other for power and the additional ports.</p>\n",

A dock with a DisplayPort port and USB 2.1 probably can do 4K@60Hz. \n\nI recently bought a [BenQ 4K monitor](https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html) and when I connected it to the USB-C dock that I had I found out that the dock could only support 4K at 30HZ, which is noticeably slow just when moving the mouse on the screen. Just about all the computer monitors we use support 60 Hz refresh rates. \n\nNow, I was using my Pixelbook with the dock and I found that when I connect it to the monitor using a USB-C cable it can do 4K@60Hz, so I figured the dock was the limiting factor, which I confirmed on the manufacture's web site. I then started to search for docks that say they can do 4K@60Hz and decided on the [Anker PowerExpander](https://us.anker.com/products/a8392). \n\nAs you probably imagine by now, I got the new dock yesterday and found it also is only doing 4K@30Hz, on the HDMI and DisplayPorts. Sigh. I tested the dock with another computer and it does 4K@60Hz, so I am back looking at the Pixelbook. \n\nI have since learned from [this article](https://www.bigmessowires.com/2019/05/19/explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub/) that the problem is that USB-C docks need to support data transfer as well as display and that decreases the number of lanes that are available for display at high refresh rates to two, whereas 4K@60Hz needs all four lanes. When you connect the Pixelbook to a monitor with a USB-C cable it can use all four of the cable's communication lanes to enable it to handle 4K@60Hz. \n\nAnker's site says 4K on DisplayPort requires DisplayPort 1.4 and I have found that the Pixelbook only supports DisplayPort 1.2. As the article I found explains, DisplayPort 1.4 only needs two lanes for 4K@60Hz because it has an additional high bit rate mode and compression, which is why the Anker hub I have can do 4K@60Hz while also providing USB 3.1 data transfers. The problem is that the computer, hub, and monitor all need to support DisplayPort 1.4 for this all to work, and the Pixelbook does not. \n\nThe lesson from this experience is that connecting to high resolution monitors at high refresh rates via a hub is more complicated than simply using a cable because it requires understanding the technical capabilities of the computer, hub, and monitor. You may have to dig to find out whether a computer, and a Chromebook in particular, supports DisplayPort 1.4. Thunderbolt 3 also supports 4K@60Hz and fast data transfers but is not yet available in Chromebooks and Thunderbolt 3 docks are more expensive than USB-C docks. \n\nI think my experience that I've written about here explains why [Google recently announced](https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/chromebook-docking-stations/) the addition of docks to their \"Works With Chromebook\" program. If Google were to announced a new Pixelbook this summer that had DisplayPort 1.4 support (or Thunderbolt 3) it would be helpful to know exactly which Docks can do 4K@60Hz. \n\nAs for my current situation, even though this new Anker dock cannot provide 4K@60Hz with my Pixelbook, it has more display ports to drive multiple monitors and has more data ports than the hub it replaced, so I still have an upgrade over the dock I was using previously. However, had I known what I now know prior to purchasing this Anker dock, I probably would have bought [this Cable Matters dock](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B06Y5N3YCD/?tag=runworks-20) instead as I could live with USB 2.1. For now I using the slightly lower 2560 x 1600 resolution at 60Hz rather than 4K, but if I really want 4K I can connect directly to the monitor via one USB-C port and use the dock on the other for power and the additional ports. \n",

				"content_text": ">\"You want to know what this was really all about?” he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison, had little left to protect. “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs?

To me, it boils down to one issue, politics. It seems that in western countries led by elected leaders, decisions and lack of decisions were due to the calculus of political consequences. For example, the Trump administration&rsquo;s slow response was due to all decisions made in terms of whether they help or hinder their ability to be re-elected.

				"content_text": "I read [this long piece](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/how-the-west-lost-covid-19.html) about how western countries have struggled to respond to COVID, which resulted in a tremendous loss of life. To me, it boils down to one issue, politics. It seems that in western countries led by elected leaders, decisions and lack of decisions were due to the calculus of political consequences. For example, the Trump administration's slow response was due to all decisions made in terms of whether they help or hinder their ability to be re-elected. In the east there were no worries about election consequences, so there was probably little debate over whether to move fast or be alarmist.\n\nIn the United States we seemed to have lost the idea that there should be non-partisans in government positions so they focus entirely on the public interest and not on their political ambitions.

Today I learned that RealVNC Server is now available for the beta but has to be enabled via the terminal using raspi-config, so I switched. I don't know whether anyone else will find this useful, but it feels like RealVNC is faster than x11vnc.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve responded <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/196\">to this question</a> about &ldquo;what does one do with ideas&rdquo; with my wish for how products like Roam could be even better for me. In summary, I want an app like Roam that recognizes a string of text as the same as the title of an already existing page and automactically converts it to a link to that page without my having to specify it as such with square brackets.</p>\n\n<p>I think the challenge is putting the &ldquo;new idea&rdquo; in a place that is connected/related in a way that easily re-surfaces. A common practice is to put all ideas in to one bucket/tickler file and then continually reviewing that bucket/tickler file, which itself requires discipline.</p>\n\n<p>Roam has a nice feature that enables me to easily associate text to a future date so when that date arrives the app automatically displays that item.

				"content_text": "I've responded [to this question](https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/196) about \"what does one do with ideas\" with my wish for how products like Roam could be even better for me. In summary, I want an app like Roam that recognizes a string of text as the same as the title of an already existing page and automactically converts it to a link to that page without my having to specify it as such with square brackets. \n\nI think the challenge is putting the \"new idea\" in a place that is connected/related in a way that easily re-surfaces. A common practice is to put all ideas in to one bucket/tickler file and then continually reviewing that bucket/tickler file, which itself requires discipline. \n\nRoam has a nice feature that enables me to easily associate text to a future date so when that date arrives the app automatically displays that item. Roam isn't unique in this feature and associating to dates is probably an easy problem to solve, but what I would like would be an automated way associate an idea to a topic that can re-surface whenever I search for or write about the topic. \n\nThe closest example I can think of is glossary function in Fargo or wiki links in Roam but even those require remembering special functions, quotes for glossary, square brackets for wiki links.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/2020/11/28/i-think-that.html\">On Saturday I wrote</a> that I think the real root cause behind why so many align themselves with Trump is the lack of good paying jobs that don&rsquo;t require a college degree. In his recent column for the New York Times, titled <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/26/opinion/republican-disinformation.html\">The Rotting of the Republican Mind</a>, David Brooks pretty much writes the same thing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Under Trump, the Republican identity is defined not by a set of policy beliefs but by a paranoid mind-set&hellip;.You can’t argue people out of paranoia. If you try to point out factual errors, you only entrench false belief. The only solution is to reduce the distrust and anxiety that is the seedbed of this thinking. That can only be done first by contact, reducing the social chasm between the members of the epistemic regime and those who feel so alienated from it. And second, it can be done by policy, by making life more secure for those without a college degree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In my opinion, while Brooks is putting the focus on Republican&rsquo;s, I think the same challenge lies with Democrats. The problem is that Trump and the Republican party really haven&rsquo;t done anything about the problem because they can&rsquo;t see the root cause, which I think is a combination of corporate greed by way of profit margins and a long history of anti-inflation that has conditioned us to seek out the lowest price for items we buy. (Have you ever enjoyed the thrill of finding a bargain?) I don&rsquo;t think either party is willing and able to do what is needed to address this issue.</p>\n\n<p>As a thought exercise ask yourself, why is it that so many of the products you use every day are manufactured outside of the United States? (If you can find a label, take a look at it to see whether I am right or wrong.)</p>\n\n<p>Many politicians of both parties will have you believe the problem is unfair trade practices by countries like China, which is the thinking behind Trump&rsquo;s tariffs that really did not result in more manufacturing jobs in the United States. Trade is a problem, but it&rsquo;s not the only problem.</p>\n\n<p>Corporations do not manufacture in the United States because it costs more to manufacture items in the United States and what does that mean? Higher costs result in lower profit margins and if corporations want to maintain margins, which shareholders want them to do, then they have to increase the price of their products, but the problem with that is U.S. consumers do not like to pay higher prices. It appears something has to give, either corporations take lower profits or consumers pay higher prices. (And equally important because nearly everyone who can save for retirement does with either IRAs or 401ks is that a good number of the shareholders demanding margins that increase stock price are consumers of the products being manufactured.)</p>\n\n<p>Can corporations and shareholders be convinced to live with lower profit margins for the sake of the country? Can consumers be convinced to pay more for items &ldquo;made in the U.S.A.&rdquo;? Can US manufacturing costs, a high portion of which is labor, be decreased?</p>\n\n<p>You see here then the issue, there is no silver bullet, instead there is a need for a comprehensive solution that requires compromise by all parties. Democrats have to be willing to decrease regulations that increase manufacturing costs and Republicans have to be willing to work toward removing corporations&rsquo; burden of providing healthcare to its employees, which also increases the costs of labor. Serious discussion needs to occur within corporations and their boards of what is a fair profit margin and not just what they can drive the market toward (the starting point might be, what is a fair wage for CEOs?) and there needs to be a significant and continuous, buy made in the USA, marketing campaign to try to influence consumer purchasing.</p>\n\n<p>The irony in all of this is that there was a time when both Republicans and Democrats campaigned on jobs, and jobs/the economy is still the issue now more than ever.

Scapegoating is an addictive drug, one feels good about &ldquo;sticking to it to the libretards,&rdquo; but when/if one looks around for change they will find no change to be found.

				"content_html": "<p>It should be clear that Democrats need to work on their strategy for Presidential elections. If one is willing to listen to me, I have the following observations.</p>\n\n<p>Simply getting out the vote will not work. It seems the conclusion drawn from 2016 is that Clinton lost because not enough Democrats voted. The thinking is based on the belief there are more Democrats than Republicans in the United States.

If one is willing to listen to me, I have the following observations.\n\nSimply getting out the vote will not work.

America's greatness is thus truly determined by the people who live in countries other than the United States of America. \n\nWe were first considered great in 1787 when we did something never done before by creating a nation governed by citizens rather than ruled by monarchs. Any doubt was removed by the end of World War II when we saved the world from fascism. \n\nUnfortunately we got drunk on our own press clippings, puffed our chest, and started trying to impose our superiority upon the world, first in Korea, then in Vietnam, and as we started losing the \"war\" in Vietnam the government declared war on its own citizens, which has been raging toward the near boiling point that we are experiencing now. \n\nIt turns out to be great you do have to care about others. Nobody ever thought to be great was so self centered as to not be willing to sacrifice for the other. \n",

The instructions configure the Pi so that you connect an iPad to the Pi using a USB-C cable. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR6sDcKo3V8\">A video</a> is also available that provides step-by-step instructions, and you can also watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPSlyqo5Q2Q\">another video</a> in which the author answers questions that were left in the comments of the original video.</p>\n\n<p>While I found the concept intriguing there is no way I could implement it because it only works if you have the latest iPad Pro that has a USB-C port, which I do not have.</p>\n\n<p>Later I found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbvSS8MJm2s\">another video</a> done by the author of the original one showing how to install an application called <a href=\"https://raspap.com/\">RaspAP</a> and configure it to be a WiFi hotspot AND a WiFi client at the same time. With this configuration you can connect any iPad, or any other device that has WiFi and then you can SSH in to the Pi from the iPad to have access to a Linux command prompt, from which you could run a number of different applications, programming environments, and utilities.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s actually not too difficult to configure a Raspberry Pi as a WiFi hotspot (access point) and I actually had done so to a small Raspberry Pi Zero W that I have been using as a portable backup for a wiki I maintain of home information. The problem with how I have been using the Pi Zero is that it can only be either a WiFi access point OR a WiFi client, so when configured as an access point the Pi Zero can&rsquo;t connect to my home network or the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>What makes RaspAP better is that it configures a Raspberry Pi so that it can be an access point AND WiFi client at the same time using the same wlan port! I am not sure how this is done because as you may know a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; WiFi access point must have a second wired Ethernet connection to connect to a cable modem and provide Internet access, in such instances the access point routes (or bridges) network traffic between two networks (different IP addressing), one being the WiFi network and the other being the wired network, each requiring one port.</p>\n\n<p>The installation of RaspAP does require connecting the Raspberry Pi to a wired network connection because there is a step that requires resetting the wlan0 interface that will hang if the port is in use. However, after installation, the Pi will connect to your home network and act as an access point for another network at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way I also found out that I can power the Raspberry Pi 3b+ using the Ravpower  (Model RP-PB043) portable battery that I own, which means that I have a portable, wireless network between an iPad and and a Linux computer that will work anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>How might I use this set up?</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say I am working on a Nodejs program. I can have Nodejs installed on the Raspberry Pi and I can have all my code also on that Pi, perhaps cloned from a git repo. Let&rsquo;s say I plan to be on a long flight and I want to carry a minimal amount of gear. I can pack my iPad Pro, Raspberry Pi, and the Ravpower in my carry on and when I am able, power up the Pi, leave it in the carry on, and connect to it via WiFi from the iPad. At this point I can then SSH into the Pi and use a text editor (emacs, nano, etc..) to work on my code and test it using nodejs. Of course, you can do this for any other programming environments or compilers that install on the Raspberry Pi and run via the command prompt. (Actually.. one should also be able to VNC into the graphical Raspbarian environment if you need to.)</p>\n\n<p>While I could do the above via the airplane WiFi, doing so costs money and service can be spotty, this network connectivity once configured is available nearly the same way all the time. The &ldquo;remote programmer&rdquo; scenario is just one idea off the top of my head, I am sure there are other uses cases for a configuration such as this.

If you have a cap and will automatically charge overages, I think you must at least provide daily stats.

Something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, my usage as around 775 GB per month and with no other change other than the bandwidth increase I don&rsquo;t know what we have been doing differently.

				"content_text": "Today electing a president is not about issues, nor is it about changing minds, nor is it about who looks better and sounds better of TV. The election is not about a personal popularity contest. Electing a president is now simply about opposition. In short, there is no middle ground just as the middle class has grown increasingly small. \n\nIf you identify Republican you are likely going to only vote for Republicans because you think all Democrats are crazy and will destroy the country. Likewise, if you identify Democrat you will only vote Democrat. If you really don't like your candidate you will not vote, or write in Mickey Mouse rather than cast a vote for the opposing party.\n\nThe consequence is that the candidates only say what their \"base\" wants to  hear, and it doesn't even matter of what is said is true. Candidates don't really try to change people's minds. In this environment, do we really need debates?  Worse, there is little for few remaing, truly \"independent\" voters to hear, and frankly doing a bunch of research is too much work for the average voter.

All three branches align to one party and then Congress and the Supreme Court do nothing more than rubber stamp anything the President requests and you have in place a dictatorship. \n\nThe Supreme Court is not supposed to be political but it now totally is ever since the Reagan administration. \n\nThe Congress is supposed to be the primary means of checks and balances but that too has turned into nothing more than alignment with the President since Vietnam. \n\nThe fourth estate, the press, is now corporately owned and no longer fulfills its defacto role in government given to it by the first amendment. \n\nAnd finally, we seem to no longer really have U.S. Citizens, instead we are people who see themselves as Conservative or Liberal, Republican or Democrat. \n\nYou don't need a civil war. Democracy in the U.S. will fail without a single shot fired no matter the interpretation of the second amendment. \n",

Fit has even suggested in an increase in my goals after using the defaults and monitoring my activity for a few days. \n\nOne problem that I do have with my watch, which is a Fossil Q Explorist, is that the battery life has been worse since upgrading my phone to Android P. I am not sure that is the exact correlation, but it feels to be the case. I've had several occurrences of the battery running out on my watch by early evening, which was not an issue in the past. \n",

Tech's return to college hockey prominence started when Pearson took the helm. \n\nPearson's last game as Tech's head coach was the 2017 WCHA championship game in which [the Huskies beat Bowling Green](http://www.wcha.com/men/pres1617/201703/mar12wcm.php) to take the Broadmore Trophy and the NCAA tourney bid. What better way for the Falcons to gain revenge for that loss than by beating Tech in their tournament in the new arena and carry home the MacInnes Cup, named for legendary Tech coach [John MacInnes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_MacInnes)? \n",
