				"title": "New iPads: Deja vu All Over Again",
				"content_html": "<p>I was mostly offline the last week as I on the road visiting family and friends. Catching up on my feeds, I see the reactions to the reviews of the new iPads that are predictable because they have been the same for the last five years or so now. All new iPad hardware is fantastic but hampered by the  operating system software. The real problem with these observations is that they are redundant and pointless unless one is reviewing a new release of iPad OS.</p>\n<p>All technical reviews are opinion pieces. Ultimately, the author of the review is expressing an opinion about whether the product being reviewed is good or bad and whether the reader should buy the product or not, and I think it is the later point some people are reacting to.  Two types of readers/potential buyers exist, a small group of whom have never owned an iPad and another group that will considering upgrading from an older model to a new model.</p>\n<p>The decision to upgrade is the tougher one because there are really few reasons to upgrade. The iPad Air I bought in 2020 runs everything I need it to run and will get the latest version of iPad OS when it is released. When I read in a review that iPad OS does not take full advantage of the hardware capability my simple translation is, it&rsquo;s not worth the money to upgrade.

				"content_text": "I was mostly offline the last week as I on the road visiting family and friends. Catching up on my feeds, I see the reactions to the reviews of the new iPads that are predictable because they have been the same for the last five years or so now. All new iPad hardware is fantastic but hampered by the  operating system software. The real problem with these observations is that they are redundant and pointless unless one is reviewing a new release of iPad OS. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nAll technical reviews are opinion pieces. Ultimately, the author of the review is expressing an opinion about whether the product being reviewed is good or bad and whether the reader should buy the product or not, and I think it is the later point some people are reacting to.  Two types of readers/potential buyers exist, a small group of whom have never owned an iPad and another group that will considering upgrading from an older model to a new model. \n\nThe decision to upgrade is the tougher one because there are really few reasons to upgrade. The iPad Air I bought in 2020 runs everything I need it to run and will get the latest version of iPad OS when it is released. When I read in a review that iPad OS does not take full advantage of the hardware capability my simple translation is, it's not worth the money to upgrade. (Ironic side note, the iPad seems to be opposite of planned obsolescence and there seems to be a negative reaction, which makes me wonder whether we are too condition for planned obsolescence. ) \n\nShould a person who does not own an IPad buy the latest one?

Editorials usually invite disagreement and so it is surprising when the authors of these articles are surprised by the disagreement as if they don't know they wrote an editorial rather than a review. If the same story is being written after every release of a new iPad, perhaps it's time for a different story.\n",

You might recognize how on the right side of many blogs there are lists like Recent Posts and Archives such as on one of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my WordPress sites<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, the placement of a blogroll is consistent with that layout.</p>\n<p>When I compare the layout of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my WordPress site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Daynotes site<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the column to the right in WordPress appears to be a part of the page whereas the blogroll on the Daynotes page is obviously a different part.

The blogroll support in micro.blog, which is being called Recommendations, is not connected to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Feedland<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which means the list of blog sites is stored and maintained separately and that is unfortunate. You can import an OPML file of the sites to micro.blog, but then have to maintain the items in micro.blog rather than in Feedland.  One can delete and re-create a Recommendation, however.</p>\n<p>Another difference is that micro.blog produces a static list, which is consistent with how blogrolls originally function, but doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of Dave&rsquo;s latest work that shows which of the sites have new posts to read. On the other hand, the links to the sites in the list is much more obvious to the reader than with the blogroll widget that Dave created. Compare the list on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Daynotes page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogroll page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I have created here. On the Daynotes page I can tell which blog has been recently updated, then a user has to click to expand to see the entries of the site and then know to click the date/time to the right of an entry to read the item. On the blogroll page all you see is the hyperlink to the site, which is more obvious to a reader, but one then has to go to each site to discover and read new entries. Tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>The blogroll of my main blog is part of a page of the site that the reader needs to navigate to, which is due to my choice of template rather than a limitation of micro.blog. Manton&rsquo;s blog shows the list of Recommended Blogs <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on its main page.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I am personally torn on which is better because I like having just my writing appearing on the blog pages rather than the right side items you see on some sites. On the other hand, if the blogroll is not on the main page what is the probability that a reader will ever see it? I guess this begs the question, do readers actually click through to any of the sites on the blogroll?</p>",

Back when blogging was more social than commercial blogrolls where a method of helping readers to find other blogs to read.  You might recognize how on the right side of many blogs there are lists like Recent Posts and Archives such as on one of <a href=\"https://realpersonalcomputing.com/\">my WordPress sites</a>, the placement of a blogroll is consistent with that layout. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhen I compare the layout of <a href=\"https://realpersonalcomputing.com/\">my WordPress site</a> to <a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/frank.mcpherson@gmail.com/\">my Daynotes site</a> the column to the right in WordPress appears to be a part of the page whereas the blogroll on the Daynotes page is obviously a different part. It's a nit I know, but I prefer how it looks in WordPress when I compare the two.  \n\nShortly after Dave began posting about his work, Manton <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2024/03/11/recommendations-and-blogrolls.html\">added blogroll support</a> to <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">micro.blog</a>, albeit with some differences. The blogroll support in micro.blog, which is being called Recommendations, is not connected to <a href=\"https://feedland.com\">Feedland</a>, which means the list of blog sites is stored and maintained separately and that is unfortunate. You can import an OPML file of the sites to micro.blog, but then have to maintain the items in micro.blog rather than in Feedland.  One can delete and re-create a Recommendation, however.\n\nAnother difference is that micro.blog produces a static list, which is consistent with how blogrolls originally function, but doesn't take advantage of Dave's latest work that shows which of the sites have new posts to read. On the other hand, the links to the sites in the list is much more obvious to the reader than with the blogroll widget that Dave created. Compare the list on <a href=\"http://daynotes.frankm.info\">my Daynotes page</a> to the new <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/other-bloggers/\">blogroll page</a> I have created here. On the Daynotes page I can tell which blog has been recently updated, then a user has to click to expand to see the entries of the site and then know to click the date/time to the right of an entry to read the item. On the blogroll page all you see is the hyperlink to the site, which is more obvious to a reader, but one then has to go to each site to discover and read new entries. Tradeoffs.\n\nThe blogroll of my main blog is part of a page of the site that the reader needs to navigate to, which is due to my choice of template rather than a limitation of micro.blog. Manton's blog shows the list of Recommended Blogs <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/\">on its main page.</a> I am personally torn on which is better because I like having just my writing appearing on the blog pages rather than the right side items you see on some sites. On the other hand, if the blogroll is not on the main page what is the probability that a reader will ever see it? I guess this begs the question, do readers actually click through to any of the sites on the blogroll?\n",

				"title": "We Need An Emoluments Amendment",
				"content_html": "<p>I don&rsquo;t think it controversial to say that much of what ills the government of the United States is caused by money. What may be controversial is that I do not think giving money is an expression of free speech, rather I think the act of giving money is an emolument. Limiting the amount of money a corporation, committee, or individual gives to an elected official is not an infringement on free speech. Common sense tells us this and yet in 1990 SCOTUS in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission<!-- raw HTML omitted --> said otherwise. In order to make a more perfect union, as Madison wrote in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the preamble to the Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, I think we need clear definition that giving of money to elected officials in our republic is an emolument rather than an express of free speech.</p>\n<p>The difference between money and speech lies in how much the person receiving either needs what is offered. Today elected officials, particularly federal officials, need a lot of money. The amounts of money needed by a person to be elected to office makes it something more than speech because it enables a smaller number of people to influence the person elected. One&rsquo;s need of money and the receipt of that money is a quid pro quo; the giver of the money expects something in return and that expectation makes the giving of money an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->emolument<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Federalist 39<!-- raw HTML omitted --> James Madison wrote, &ldquo;If we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established, we may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior. It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The founders knew how emoluments could lead to corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because they lived in a time when it was common practice for foreign countries to gain favor from monarchs by gift giving. Emoluments are not given as an act of generosity, they are given with the expectation of something in return. If you think about it, you could say that emoluments, the giving of gifts of large sums of money, is simply capitalism at work, and here in lies the circumstances we find ourselves in today.</p>\n<p>We in the United States, so accustomed to our highly capitalistic society, have become numb to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->corrosive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> nature of money and thus think little of emoluments. If we were to write the Constitution today we might not even include emolument clauses in it because they have become such a part of everyday life. The other side of that coin, however, is that everyone in our capitalistic society knows full well that when one person or one committee or one corporation writes a check for thousands, hundreds of thousands or more dollars to a politician it is done with the expectation of something in return. Enough money from a small group of people gains more influence than a citizen could ever hope to gain through exercising their right to free speech. Isn&rsquo;t this how elected officials pretty much ignore what their constituents say?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is it that emoluments from &ldquo;any King, Prince, or foreign State&rdquo; is worse than emoluments from citizens, corporations, or Political Action Committees?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today, like many things, many tend to take a literal view of corruption and emoluments. Huge election donations and lobbying come with expectations that effectively buy votes, but we don&rsquo;t think of this as corruption, at least not legally. However, I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can deny that huge part of our lack of trust in the institutions of government, or media (journalism), or medicine, is due in large part to an awareness of how much influence on decisions is being bought. The growing lack of trust in government is the corrosion (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) of the Republic in plain sight. (Further, if you think about it, much of the lack of trust in Biden or Trump is due to money!)</p>\n<p>The founders of the United States knew full well the affect emoluments can have on a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->republic<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which is why they included <!-- raw HTML omitted -->clauses in the Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to limit that affect. Unfortunately, the ideology of originalism says that literal words, not the meaning or intent, only matters. (Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism can mean that Supreme Court Justices could be replaced by AI.)  Originalists will say, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 only has the words &ldquo;from any King, Prince, or foreign State&rdquo; and there is no such prohibition of emoluments given from citizens of the United States, even if the very thing that clause was intended to prevent, which is the corruption of the government through quid pro quo, is what is happening.</p>",

Limiting the amount of money a corporation, committee, or individual gives to an elected official is not an infringement on free speech. Common sense tells us this and yet in 1990 SCOTUS in <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained?ref=foreverwars.ghost.io\">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</a> said otherwise. In order to make a more perfect union, as Madison wrote in <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/us#:~:text=%22We%20the%20People%20of%20the,for%20the%20United%20States%20of\">the preamble to the Constitution</a>, I think we need clear definition that giving of money to elected officials in our republic is an emolument rather than an express of free speech.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe difference between money and speech lies in how much the person receiving either needs what is offered. Today elected officials, particularly federal officials, need a lot of money. The amounts of money needed by a person to be elected to office makes it something more than speech because it enables a smaller number of people to influence the person elected. One's need of money and the receipt of that money is a quid pro quo; the giver of the money expects something in return and that expectation makes the giving of money an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/emolument\">emolument</a>. \n\n>In <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed39.asp\">Federalist 39</a> James Madison wrote, \"If we resort for a criterion to the different principles on which different forms of government are established, we may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior. It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.\" \n\n<a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11086#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20Domestic,to%20exert%20influence%20over%20him.\">The founders knew how emoluments could lead to corruption</a> because they lived in a time when it was common practice for foreign countries to gain favor from monarchs by gift giving. Emoluments are not given as an act of generosity, they are given with the expectation of something in return. If you think about it, you could say that emoluments, the giving of gifts of large sums of money, is simply capitalism at work, and here in lies the circumstances we find ourselves in today. \n\nWe in the United States, so accustomed to our highly capitalistic society, have become numb to the <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/corrosive\">corrosive</a> nature of money and thus think little of emoluments. If we were to write the Constitution today we might not even include emolument clauses in it because they have become such a part of everyday life. The other side of that coin, however, is that everyone in our capitalistic society knows full well that when one person or one committee or one corporation writes a check for thousands, hundreds of thousands or more dollars to a politician it is done with the expectation of something in return. Enough money from a small group of people gains more influence than a citizen could ever hope to gain through exercising their right to free speech. Isn't this how elected officials pretty much ignore what their constituents say?\n\n>Why is it that emoluments from \"any King, Prince, or foreign State\" is worse than emoluments from citizens, corporations, or Political Action Committees?\n\nToday, like many things, many tend to take a literal view of corruption and emoluments. Huge election donations and lobbying come with expectations that effectively buy votes, but we don't think of this as corruption, at least not legally. However, I don't know how anyone can deny that huge part of our lack of trust in the institutions of government, or media (journalism), or medicine, is due in large part to an awareness of how much influence on decisions is being bought. The growing lack of trust in government is the corrosion (<a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=corruption\">corruption</a>) of the Republic in plain sight. (Further, if you think about it, much of the lack of trust in Biden or Trump is due to money!)\n\nThe founders of the United States knew full well the affect emoluments can have on a <a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/stop-saying-were-republic-not-democracy?gad_source=1\">republic</a>, which is why they included <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11086#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20Domestic,to%20exert%20influence%20over%20him.\">clauses in the Constitution</a> to limit that affect. Unfortunately, the ideology of originalism says that literal words, not the meaning or intent, only matters. (Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism can mean that Supreme Court Justices could be replaced by AI.)  Originalists will say, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 only has the words \"from any King, Prince, or foreign State\" and there is no such prohibition of emoluments given from citizens of the United States, even if the very thing that clause was intended to prevent, which is the corruption of the government through quid pro quo, is what is happening.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The Chicago Cubs have completed the 2024 Cactus League spring training &ldquo;season&rdquo; and will start the 2024 MLB season tomorrow at the Texas Rangers. As many questions exist about the 2024 team as did for the 2023 team, so it is hard for me to expect them to be too much better than last year.

Most Cub fans will say that Suzuki has not yet lived up to his potential, but we saw signs of that at the end of last year. I think it interesting that Suzuki may be hitting second to start the season so that he and Bellinger get as many at bats as possible during games. (Bellinger must bat no lower than third all season so he gets as many at bats as possible, something that David Ross refused to do last year.)</p>\n<p>The two biggest (or three biggest depending on how you count) questions for the Cubs going in to this season are, will Morel and Busch succeed at third and first base and how will the starting pitching perform? Morel will get his best chance to prove he can be a reliable third baseman and Busch will get a chance to prove that he can produce at the plate. The Cubs have been searching for the next players at third and first ever since they traded away Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo, and from fans' perspective that search has taken too long.</p>\n<p>Many more questions exist about the pitching staff, but I think they start with will Jameson Taillon live up to expectations? Taillon was the Cubs big pitching pick up before the 2023 season and he did not pitch well and had several injuries. The fact that Taillon is starting the 2024 season on the injury list does not bode well. I think the Cubs need Taillon to meet expectations for them to have a chance to win the N.L. Central.</p>\n<p>Will Justin Steele and Kyle Hendricks repeat their performances in 2023? We will find out soon given that Steele will pitch against the defending World Series champions on Thursday night and then Hendricks will follow him on Saturday. Finally, will Shota Imanaga meet expectations in his first season or falter as many players do when moving from Japan to the United States?</p>\n<p>Finally will the youngsters, Jordan Wicks and Javier Assad, improve upon their performances in 2023? The long term view for the Cubs relies heavily on their ability to promote pitching from within, and while Steele is a success story the MLB teams most successful over long periods of time have nearly their entire pitching staff come up from their farm system.</p>\n<p>The 2016 World Series team had an established pitching staff so going in to that season there were more questions about their hitting and fielding than pitching. The 2024 team has significant questions in all three areas, which means the probability for them to have playoff success, if they make the playoffs, is lower than in 2016. Given that the Cubs have a new manager it might be more fair to compare this team to the 2015 team that made it to the NL championship, which is the first year Joe Maddon managed the team.</p>\n<p>Despite the first year manager comparisons, I think it might be better to compare this team, or rather the entire Cubs organization, to the 2014 team. Back in 2014 many of their future stars were still in the minor leagues but on the brink of making it to the majors. During the 2024 spring training we saw many of the Cubs' future stars like Matt Shaw and Pete Crow-Armstrong perform well but sent back to the minors for further development.

When the rumors of the demise of Evernote started appearing I began testing ways to export my information out of the application and import it into others. Two years ago I exported everything from Evernote to OneNote, which wasn&rsquo;t perfect but good enough for me to find information should I need to.

Deleting my notes was much more laborious than I would have preferred, as a deleted note is moved to Trash and then one has to empty the Trash in order to completely delete the note and I found that Trash emptying seemed to only handle about 100 notes or so at a time, particularly with the web application.

I imagine personal computing as the mashup of hardware + software + Internet + intelligence.\n\n<a href=\"http://oldschool.scripting.com/frank.mcpherson@gmail.com/2024/01/10/150158.html\">Today I learned</a> via <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2024/01/09/excited-to-see.html\">manton</a> about <a href=\"https://rabbit.tech\">Rabbit Inc</a>. and a mobile device and operating system it has introduced built around a Large Language Model and what the company calls a Large Action Model to provide a user interface based on natural language processing and execute actions rather than generate text and pictures. I don't know whether the NLP works as well is demoed, but the demo at least shows exactly how I imagined how personal computing should work. Speech is our primary mode of interaction and typing is really abnormal and frankly unknown to the majority of people in the world. \n\nI think the software is the most important part of what Rabbit Inc. has made, the purpose of the device is to prove the software's functioning and capability. If it does perform as well as shown, I expect the company and product to be acquired by one of the big tech firms.\n",

Practically, once a person has proven to be a loser <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2023/11/27/its-a-revenue-problem-panic-over-plummeting-finances-as-donors-grow-frustrated-with/\">the power of the dollar</a> moves on to a different person. In this context one can understand Trump's continued insistence that he won the 2020 election, or at worst Biden stole it, for the sake of being relevant and gaining the money needed for him to run again. It appears many past Republican donors are holding out, probably because they really don't want to waste their money on a loser.

Nearly all of the teams they faced need to beat them to move ahead of the Cubs in the Wild Card playoff standings. By my count the Cubs have played 17 games so far in September and in 7 of them their opponent scored 3 or fewer runs. My conclusion is that the Cubs pitching is simply not good enough to win in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>I think my conclusion holds if you look at the larger body of work over the season. I expect that in a high percentage of the games the Cubs won they scored 4 or more runs, too many of those they needed to score 4 or more runs. During the regular season it is not surprising that your hitters will have more success because they will be in many situations where they face poor pitching.</p>\n<p>A team built to win in the MLB playoffs has the pitching that more often than not can hold their opponent to 3 or fewer runs. Truth is the Cubs got through the 2023 season with only one reliable starting pitcher, maybe two (Steele for sure, and possibly Hendricks). Stroman and Taillon have not been consistent and Taillon has been aweful. Javier Assad joined the starting rotation too late in to the season so it is really hard to assess his reliability. The bullpen is no better, only Merrywather and Alzolay has been reliable, though Leiter is borderline.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Cubs are in a playoff race is much more important this year than they actually make the playoffs, and the goal long term is be winning division championships and not gain a playoff berth via the wild card. While at the beginning of the season there was some hope the Cubs could compete with the Brewers for the NL Central division championship, I think it was evident early on through head to head games with the Brewers that this Cubs team is not as good or better than the Brewers. Sure, the Cubs can win any game, but can they win a series?</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Chicago Cubs are on schedule for their long term goals of winning division titles and the World Series in upcoming years. Clearly, the Cubs need to improve their pitching. Jordan Wicks has shown he is a piece of the puzzle for next year, and we can hope Taillon will return to the how he pitched in the past. Stroman might be back, but with Hendricks being another year older I think the Cubs need to sign at least two reliable starting pitchers during the off season as well as keep Merryweather.</p>\n<p>From the lineup perspective, I think the Cubs should be aggressive in their attempt to sign Bellinger, but I doubt he stays and his departure will create a big gap in their lineup. Maybe youngsters Morel, Mervis, or Crow-Armstrong can help fill that gap but all are too inexperienced with MLB pitching. Consequently, the Cubs need to sign at least one big-name hitter to maintain their current starting lineup performance.</p>\n<p>Finally, the biggest question of the off season might be whether David Ross has what it takes to manage a championship caliber baseball team.

I personally can&rsquo;t pin the current Cubs situation on Ross, the bottom line is that the players have to perform and they are not performing. Ross has made lineup changes and pitching changes, as far as I can tell he is doing everything he can to try and have the Cubs win games. I would not be in a hurry to replace Ross unless there is a championship experienced person to replace him.

In the big picture I am happy about where the Cubs are, they met my expectations for this season and look to be on track of near year and beyond.

Problem is, demographics and generations change and so there are ways for reform to occur within our current form of government, which is why I think conservatives are fighting so hard because they feel if they don't take action their control will cease. \n",

The Pixel 7a is replacing the Pixel 4a that has been my everyday carry phone for the last three years. I really like the size and feel of the Pixel 4a and so I was not eager to up-size to the newer phone, but it has come to the end of the road with Android and there are features the 7a has that make the upgrade a &ldquo;no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>My main concern about the Pixel 7a has been its size and glossy back. The Pixel 7a is taller than the Pixel 4a and because of that I find it harder to operate with one hand. The weight, however, is the most noticeable difference. I am finding that due to the weight it is more comfortable holding the phone in my left hand, but in a position where I can&rsquo;t scroll apps with that same hand and as a result this phone requires more two hand operation than the Pixel 4a. The weight and size difference is also noticeable when I put the Pixel 7a in a front pant pocket. Fortunately, the size do not make these use cases impossible, just different and I suspect the difference will become less noticeable over time.</p>\n<p>The back of the Pixel 7a is more &ldquo;polished&rdquo; than the Pixel 4a, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel so slippery that I fear it is going to quickly slip out of my hand. I purchased a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really nice Latercase<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone.</p>\n<p>Battery life appears to be better, but I don&rsquo;t know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accubattery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%. Battery life is an item that requires a longer duration to evaluate.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is just me, but I think pictures using the wide angle lens have a bit of a fish eye affect. (See the last picture on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for an example.) I don&rsquo;t think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras.</p>\n<p>I really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast.</p>\n<p>As I expected, it was a real pain to move the Pixel Watch from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google really does not understand what is a technology ecosystem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it&rsquo;s not just a suite of products that have the same appearance, it&rsquo;s products that work together with little effort by the user.

At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work.</p>\n<p>Of the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it&rsquo;s best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery.

It&rsquo;s larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the &ldquo;A Series&rdquo; pixel phones, but it&rsquo;s not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the &ldquo;small, medium, and large&rdquo; sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phone is to get a larger screen.

Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?</p>\n<p>Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited,&rdquo; 60Hz screen as my daily driver.

I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not.

Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen?

You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the &ldquo;old&rdquo; phone.</p>\n<p>Over the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets.

The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything.

I took the idea of the page redirect off my blog a step further by purchasing a domain, frankm.info, that I configured to forward to the site.

I&rsquo;ve used Drummer since its beginning and always knew that it would some day replace Little Outliner. I didn&rsquo;t move my informational outlines to Drummer until recently when Twitter made changes to its API that Dave has been using for user identity management and login. Dave announced he would be updating Drummer with a new login process and also move access of it to HTTPS.

It treated its employees more like people and less like human resources, giving them chances to learn and succeed along with the company. “I’m a great believer that in any team,” he told me, “any member is better at something than somebody else, so to get the team to perform you want everyone to perform on their best axis. Teams that work well together work better.” He emphasized the importance of being honest with employees and not overpromising what the company had to offer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above resonates with me because the company I hired in to out of college, Electronic Data Systems, had the same business model, treat employees in a similar manner, and had success. Unlike ARM, EDS went through several different owners (GM, HP, HPE, CSC/DXC) and CEOs and each change moved further from the founding vision to the point at which it no-longer really exists.</p>\n<p>The story also calls to mind <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780735213524\">The Infinite Game</a> by Steve Sinek. Using Reimer&rsquo;s comparison of ARM and Commodore, ARM was playing the infinite game, Commodore the finite game. In the book Sinek describes the reletively few businesses playing the &ldquo;infinite game&rdquo; versus the vast majority playing the &ldquo;finite&rdquo; game. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Infinite games have infinite time horizons. And because there is no finish line, no practical end to the game, there is no such thing as “winning” an infinite game. In an infinite game, the primary objective is to keep playing, to perpetuate the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having been hired by EDS and surviving through the multitude of transitions that has occurred, I have seen first hand the differences a building a company, which usually has a founder, and buying a company, which usually has a manager. In most cases bought companies are separated from their founding, has no leadership and thus no culture.</p>\n<p>It amazes me that given all the evidence of how to achieve long term success, such as ARM&rsquo;s, that so few U.S. companies are interested in the infinite game. The finite game rules business, thus it rules capitalism, and given relationship of capitalism to the United States, the finite game rules the U.S. I don&rsquo;t think prospects will change in the United States until we find leaders who are builders, right now our political, economic, and religions cultures appear to all be playing the finite game.</p>\n",

Teams buying simply decided they had needs greater than catcher.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that the Cubs make a serious attempt to signing Contreras to a new contract during the offseason. Wilson is a player worthy of being the cornerstone to the next great Cubs team, particularly given the additon of the designated hitter. You need leadership to win in any sport, and Wilson provides it to a team of young players and particularly a team with young pitchers. I think Wilson is worth the money he asks for. \n",

Ozzie Smith didn&rsquo;t make is his mark at the plate, he was known as the Wizard because of his defense. I always felt too much attention is paid to Baez&rsquo;s inconsistency at the plate and not enough value placed on his defense, which I think is worth enough to absorb his bat.</p>\n<p>Baez was not the problem in the Cubs lineup, the problem was that everyone else in the lineup was not much better.

Ozzie Smith didn't make is his mark at the plate, he was known as the Wizard because of his defense. I always felt too much attention is paid to Baez's inconsistency at the plate and not enough value placed on his defense, which I think is worth enough to absorb his bat.\n\nBaez was not the problem in the Cubs lineup, the problem was that everyone else in the lineup was not much better. Put Baez in a lineup with other players who make contact and get on base and you can live with his strikeouts, and revel in his ability in the big moments. I think in some ways Baez is like Brett Farve, high risk and high reward.

I, of course, never met this man who had an impact on the direction of my life.</p>\n<p>My chosen field of study in college, computer science, led to the career that caused me to move to metropolitan Detroit, ultimately meet and marry my wife, and have the life I now live. How I came to chose to study computer science was influenced by three events during my high school years: the arrival of the Apple II in my high school, taking an after school BASIC programming class, and being gifted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000\">the Timex Sinclair 1000</a>. Sir Sinclair invented the ZX80, the predecessor to the ZX8, in Britian, and that same computer was later sold as the Timex Sinclair 1000 in the United States.</p>\n<p>I was raised by my grandmother and we lived off social security along with some savings. The personal computers sold at the time cost well beyond our means, but the Timex Sinclair only cost $100, though you needed the nearly $40 additional cost of the 16 KB storage for it to be useful. The nearly $150 total cost made it the most expensive gift my grandmother ever bought me, and I don&rsquo;t doubt she made sacrifices to buy it, but she felt it important for my future. Turns out my grandmother was right.</p>\n<p>Even by the standards of the time, the Timex Sinclair was a bit of a joke for a computer. Frogger was one of the games available for the Timex Sinclair that my friend called &ldquo;woodtick&rdquo; because of how the large block pixel graphics of the frog took over the entire TV screen when it got run over by a car.</p>\n<p>Back then the common display for personal computers were TV screens. Programs were stored on cassete tapes. As I said, the Timex Sinclair only had 16 kilobytes of RAM. It had a membrane keyboard rather than a real keyboard that had most of the BASIC functions assigned. When writing a program you &ldquo;typed&rdquo; PRINT by pressing a combination of a function key and they key that had the command printed on it. I don&rsquo;t recall whether I ever connected the Timex Sinclair to a printer or did anything like word processing.</p>\n<p>Despite the limits Sinclair&rsquo;s invention made a brand new world of personal computing accessible to me in the comfort of my bedroom floor. Hours of typing in pre-printed programs from magazines and hours of experimenting with little BASIC programs sparked the interest that as I said led to the life I now have.</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/17/clive-sinclair-zx-spectrum-offbeat-brilliance?utm_source=pocket_mylist\">tributes and stories</a> of Sinclair, I know that I am just one of hundreds of thousands of people around the world that share the same story. What a wonderful legacy. Thank you Sir Sinclair, rest in peace.</p>\n",

How I came to chose to study computer science was influenced by three events during my high school years: the arrival of the Apple II in my high school, taking an after school BASIC programming class, and being gifted [the Timex Sinclair 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000). Sir Sinclair invented the ZX80, the predecessor to the ZX8, in Britian, and that same computer was later sold as the Timex Sinclair 1000 in the United States.\n\nI was raised by my grandmother and we lived off social security along with some savings. The personal computers sold at the time cost well beyond our means, but the Timex Sinclair only cost $100, though you needed the nearly $40 additional cost of the 16 KB storage for it to be useful. The nearly $150 total cost made it the most expensive gift my grandmother ever bought me, and I don't doubt she made sacrifices to buy it, but she felt it important for my future. Turns out my grandmother was right.\n\nEven by the standards of the time, the Timex Sinclair was a bit of a joke for a computer. Frogger was one of the games available for the Timex Sinclair that my friend called \"woodtick\" because of how the large block pixel graphics of the frog took over the entire TV screen when it got run over by a car. \n\nBack then the common display for personal computers were TV screens. Programs were stored on cassete tapes. As I said, the Timex Sinclair only had 16 kilobytes of RAM. It had a membrane keyboard rather than a real keyboard that had most of the BASIC functions assigned. When writing a program you \"typed\" PRINT by pressing a combination of a function key and they key that had the command printed on it. I don't recall whether I ever connected the Timex Sinclair to a printer or did anything like word processing. \n\nDespite the limits Sinclair's invention made a brand new world of personal computing accessible to me in the comfort of my bedroom floor. Hours of typing in pre-printed programs from magazines and hours of experimenting with little BASIC programs sparked the interest that as I said led to the life I now have. \n\nReading [tributes and stories](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/17/clive-sinclair-zx-spectrum-offbeat-brilliance?utm_source=pocket_mylist) of Sinclair, I know that I am just one of hundreds of thousands of people around the world that share the same story. What a wonderful legacy. Thank you Sir Sinclair, rest in peace.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>What made local area and wireless networks happen are industry standards that enable different vendor products to work with each other. The Internet Of Things is nearly the exact opposite, in my home is a case in point. I have Hue lights that require a Hue hub for management and I have a number of sensors and smart switches that use Zigbee that I manage with Samsung&rsquo;s SmartThings hub.</p>\n<p>The SmartThings hub can control the Hue lights, but the Hue hub only knows Hue products. I started first with the Hue lights and the hub, but if I had could have seen in the future I might have just bought the SmartThings hub. On the other hand, one big thing I get with the Hue hub is the use of a catalog of scenes that combine different colors to make for some pretty nice lighting in our basement.</p>\n<p>I recently bought two cheaper Sylvania color smartlights when recent heavy rains suggested it might be nice to have a color smartlight in our living room, right now we have a non-color Hue light in the living room. We have a moisture sensor in the sump pump pit that works with the SmartThings hub and an automation in SmartThings that turns on all of the lights when moisture is detected. The automation sets the color lights to purple (homage to Prince) but obviously cannot do that with non-color lights. It happened the automation was recently triggered during the evening when the living room light might normally come on so I realize it just turning on might not be enough notification. Thus the idea to buy a color light, thus the purpose of the Sylvania light because the Hue light costs $50.</p>\n<p>Before putting the new Sylvania light in the living room I decided to test it in the basement, where I have the color Hue lights, and here exposes the problem.

				"content_text": "What made local area and wireless networks happen are industry standards that enable different vendor products to work with each other. The Internet Of Things is nearly the exact opposite, in my home is a case in point. I have Hue lights that require a Hue hub for management and I have a number of sensors and smart switches that use Zigbee that I manage with Samsung's SmartThings hub.\n\nThe SmartThings hub can control the Hue lights, but the Hue hub only knows Hue products. I started first with the Hue lights and the hub, but if I had could have seen in the future I might have just bought the SmartThings hub. On the other hand, one big thing I get with the Hue hub is the use of a catalog of scenes that combine different colors to make for some pretty nice lighting in our basement.\n\nI recently bought two cheaper Sylvania color smartlights when recent heavy rains suggested it might be nice to have a color smartlight in our living room, right now we have a non-color Hue light in the living room. We have a moisture sensor in the sump pump pit that works with the SmartThings hub and an automation in SmartThings that turns on all of the lights when moisture is detected. The automation sets the color lights to purple (homage to Prince) but obviously cannot do that with non-color lights. It happened the automation was recently triggered during the evening when the living room light might normally come on so I realize it just turning on might not be enough notification. Thus the idea to buy a color light, thus the purpose of the Sylvania light because the Hue light costs $50. \n\nBefore putting the new Sylvania light in the living room I decided to test it in the basement, where I have the color Hue lights, and here exposes the problem. The Hue lights are controlled by the Hue hub that knows nothing about the Sylvania light, this the Sylvania light cannot be part of the any of the Hue scenes. Perhaps I can find a \"third party\" app that works with SmartThings to replace Hue scenes, but I have not yet done the research. \n\nBetter, yet, would be an industry standard for controlling these color lights that would enable me to fully control them, with scenes, from one hub or \"smart device.\" Of course, this is a known problem and industy leaders appear to be working together to address it by developing [a protocol called Matter](https://staceyoniot.com/an-faq-on-the-matter-protocol/). Hopefully, there will be a day when all I need is one controlling device, technically right now I have three: Hue hub, SmartThings hub, Amazon Echo, and Google Home.\n\nP.S. I really hope the Matter protocol addresses how smartlights handle resumption of power after a power outage. Hue added the ability to enforce the last known state, if a light was off when the power went off then it is supposed to stay off when power is restored. However, I've found that doesn't work well with multiple successive short power loses. Worse, is the fact that the Sylvania light appears to not have such a setting. When power is restored the light turns on, regardless of its prior state. \n",

A stream is ephemeral, it continues to move over time and one mostly adds to it and watches it flow away. On the Internet a stream is content for only right now, and usually isn&rsquo;t edited nor looked at years later. Streams are date and time driven. Stream platforms are optimized for quick and easy entry of new content.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, and blogs are examples of platforms used for publishing streams of content. Note that this is not absolute, for example one can and might edit a blog post they wrote a year ago in which case that blog might well be a garden.</p>\n<p>The garden metaphor, in contrast, is more permanent. The content in a garden is continually edited to reflect new ideas or new learning over a period of time. A garden is organized around a topic. Platforms for creating and maintaining gardens are optimized for editing and linking together of content. Connecting the dots (linking) between content can generate new ideas or thoughts. Wiki is an example of a garden platform, as is the web itself as originally intended, as are other tools optimized for linking together and organizing content.</p>\n<p>A couple of other interesting differences exist between the two from a user and platform provider perspective.

A dock with a DisplayPort port and USB 2.1 probably can do 4K@60Hz.</p>\n<p>I recently bought a <a href=\"https://www.benq.com/en-us/monitor/entertainment/ew3270u.html\">BenQ 4K monitor</a> and when I connected it to the USB-C dock that I had I found out that the dock could only support 4K at 30HZ, which is noticeably slow just when moving the mouse on the screen. Just about all the computer monitors we use support 60 Hz refresh rates.</p>\n<p>Now, I was using my Pixelbook with the dock and I found that when I connect it to the monitor using a USB-C cable it can do 4K@60Hz, so I figured the dock was the limiting factor, which I confirmed on the manufacture&rsquo;s web site. I then started to search for docks that say they can do 4K@60Hz and decided on the <a href=\"https://us.anker.com/products/a8392\">Anker PowerExpander</a>.</p>\n<p>As you probably imagine by now, I got the new dock yesterday and found it also is only doing 4K@30Hz, on the HDMI and DisplayPorts.

I tested the dock with another computer and it does 4K@60Hz, so I am back looking at the Pixelbook.</p>\n<p>I have since learned from <a href=\"https://www.bigmessowires.com/2019/05/19/explaining-4k-60hz-video-through-usb-c-hub/\">this article</a> that the problem is that USB-C docks need to support data transfer as well as display and that decreases the number of lanes that are available for display at high refresh rates to two, whereas 4K@60Hz needs all four lanes. When you connect the Pixelbook to a monitor with a USB-C cable it can use all four of the cable&rsquo;s communication lanes to enable it to handle 4K@60Hz.</p>\n<p>Anker&rsquo;s site says 4K on DisplayPort requires DisplayPort 1.4 and I have found that the Pixelbook only supports DisplayPort 1.2. As the article I found explains, DisplayPort 1.4 only needs two lanes for 4K@60Hz because it has an additional high bit rate mode and compression, which is why the Anker hub I have can do 4K@60Hz while also providing USB 3.1 data transfers. The problem is that the computer, hub, and monitor all need to support DisplayPort 1.4 for this all to work, and the Pixelbook does not.</p>\n<p>The lesson from this experience is that connecting to high resolution monitors at high refresh rates via a hub is more complicated than simply using a cable because it requires understanding the technical capabilities of the computer, hub, and monitor. You may have to dig to find out whether a computer, and a Chromebook in particular, supports DisplayPort 1.4. Thunderbolt 3 also supports 4K@60Hz and fast data transfers but is not yet available in Chromebooks and Thunderbolt 3 docks are more expensive than USB-C docks.</p>\n<p>I think my experience that I&rsquo;ve written about here explains why <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/chromebook-docking-stations/\">Google recently announced</a> the addition of docks to their &ldquo;Works With Chromebook&rdquo; program.

However, had I known what I now know prior to purchasing this Anker dock, I probably would have bought <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B06Y5N3YCD/?tag=runworks-20\">this Cable Matters dock</a> instead as I could live with USB 2.1. For now I using the slightly lower 2560 x 1600 resolution at 60Hz rather than 4K, but if I really want 4K I can connect directly to the monitor via one USB-C port and use the dock on the other for power and the additional ports.</p>\n",

The fact that any person considers any judges to be \"his,\" particularly Justices is frightening. \n\nWhat we must learn from this episode of U.S. history is that it matters how anyone who would be President views the powers and responsibilities of the office. The U.S. Constitution is not intended to give anyone extreme powers, its intention is exactly the opposite. The fact that people think elections are all about power shows how much we have strayed from the founding principles of the United States. \n\nIf we don't learn from this year and make meaningful changes then all we have done is prevent the end of the U.S. for the time being and increased the likelihood that it will not see its tricentennial. It takes more to preserve freedom than waving a flag and standing for the national anthem. \n",

When we get back to being able to travel around freely I will probably get Apple's Smart Folio, which also attaches magnetically, to protect the iPad Air in those instances.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It should be clear that Democrats need to work on their strategy for Presidential elections. If one is willing to listen to me, I have the following observations.</p>\n<p>Simply getting out the vote will not work. It seems the conclusion drawn from 2016 is that Clinton lost because not enough Democrats voted. The thinking is based on the belief there are more Democrats than Republicans in the United States. The problem is, increating vote count only works in a pure democratic nationwide election, aka the popular vote, and we don&rsquo;t elect Presidents in the United States by popular vote. (The founders feared a pure democracy.)</p>\n<p>Republicans have simplified the path to the White House: win rural votes by &gt; 50% margin and if you get 30% of the urban vote, you win, and that strategy aligns to the electoral college. In short, Democrats have to get more rural vote, which leads me to the one overriding fundamental that Democrats have to understand..</p>\n<p><strong>Fear of socialism trumps everything else!</strong></p>\n<p>People are not really voting on issues, which I think is why polling is not working. People are voting on fear and mostly fear of the other side. The Republican message is simple, Democrats are socialists, socialism = communism = evil = unAmercan, so vote Republican to save America!  A significant number of people are convinced they can never vote for a Democrat because that is a vote for Socialism. Add to that another significant number of people, call them evangelicals, who are convinced voting for a Demorat is a vote for killing babys and you have this result. And evangelials equate socialism to atheism which adds another reason why they fear Democrats. Then, sadly, add to the fact that there are too many who fear a vote for a Democrat is a vote for people of color over white people.</p>\n<p>If you consider that Republican votes are mostly all about fear of what Democrats will do, I think you see how the Democrat primary and compaigns of 2016 and 2020 make the election strategy for Republicans easy because policies considered to be socialist AND politicians considered to be socialists (Bernie Sanders) dominated the campaigns.</p>\n<p>In short, I think Bernie Sanders created a lot of fear among voters AND was a easy target. Even after Biden secured the nomination Republicans simply claimed Sanders would have significant influence over Biden because Democrats do want the Sanders followers support. I think this is true, hard to dispute and personally frustrating to me because Bernie is not even a Democrat!</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? It matters because for extremism to be successful it needs an equally extreme opposite. The antidote to extremism is the middle and unfortunately that is shrinking rapidly. I think the only way the middle, call them moderates, can be recovered is via a third party but how we finance and run elections in the United States in the 21st century really makes it impossible for a viable third party.</p>\n<p>In summary, fear of socialism trumps everything. It don&rsquo;t matter whether the Republican candidate is authoritarian, unqualified, and incapable of leading, it only matters that at Democrat doesn&rsquo;t get power and destroy the country.</p>\n",

The pandemic raises the question though of whether the right to liberty, which appears to be translated by most as meaning the right to do anything they want, stands above the right to life. \n\nIronic isn't it, that as we begin to witness another series of SCOTUS confirmation hearings, we are witnessing this very debate in which Republicans insist that the right to life is paramount over the liberty of a woman to choose what to do with her body. No matter then the hypocrisy of these same Republicans insisting their right to liberty is paramount over everyone else's right to life. Well, if you [seek the common denominator](https://www.businessinsider.com/gop-sen-mike-lee-says-rank-democracy-bad-for-america-2020-10) you might find there really isn't any hypocricy. \n",

A competent politician should easily gain re-election in a time of national crisis simply by being a unifying force. The fact that he hasn't done so is a clear example of his incompetence that Republicans should really be concerned about. As much as we claim we don't like politicians and think anybody can be President, the basic skills needed for the job in a Democracy is political.

It’s that America must rebuild the public-health cooperation that the Trump administration helped destroy.”\n\n[Trump’s Break With China Has Deadly Consequences](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/breaking-china-exactly-wrong-answer/608911/)\n\nIn November Americans will hopefully have the opportunity to decide whether to replace Trump as president and for that we not only need to assess how he and his administration handled this crisis, but also the ways in which he was responsible for it. \n\nThe isolationism he has been putting in place has contributed immensely to how bad COVID19 has been for the United States. As far as disease is concerned, imports and tariffs have nothing to do with it, rather it's about [the tremendous amount of global travel](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/22/world/coronavirus-spread.html) that occurs every single day. Even if you restricted travel to China you can't stop the possibility of an American being in a conference room in Germany with a person who traveled there from China. \n\nIsolationism does not work, that's the lesson the greatest generation learned and of which we are being reminded today. Let's heed the lessons well and revert to the wise decisions of prior administrations, Democrat and Republican. \n",

The Verge has taken a look at the SDK and [explained how that translates to the user experience](https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/1/23/21077846/microsoft-software-sdk-duo-android-phone-pragmatism) and I agree it sounds like Microsoft has the right approach. I do wonder, though, about how many cases where users wish they could see Android apps side by side because that appears to be one of the cases Duo will be well suited.\n",

I can pack my iPad Pro, Raspberry Pi, and the Ravpower in my carry on and when I am able, power up the Pi, leave it in the carry on, and connect to it via WiFi from the iPad. At this point I can then SSH into the Pi and use a text editor (emacs, nano, etc..) to work on my code and test it using nodejs. Of course, you can do this for any other programming environments or compilers that install on the Raspberry Pi and run via the command prompt.

The &ldquo;remote programmer&rdquo; scenario is just one idea off the top of my head, I am sure there are other uses cases for a configuration such as this.

				"content_text": "Today electing a president is not about issues, nor is it about changing minds, nor is it about who looks better and sounds better of TV. The election is not about a personal popularity contest. Electing a president is now simply about opposition. In short, there is no middle ground just as the middle class has grown increasingly small. \n\nIf you identify Republican you are likely going to only vote for Republicans because you think all Democrats are crazy and will destroy the country. Likewise, if you identify Democrat you will only vote Democrat. If you really don't like your candidate you will not vote, or write in Mickey Mouse rather than cast a vote for the opposing party.\n\nThe consequence is that the candidates only say what their \"base\" wants to  hear, and it doesn't even matter of what is said is true. Candidates don't really try to change people's minds. In this environment, do we really need debates?  Worse, there is little for few remaing, truly \"independent\" voters to hear, and frankly doing a bunch of research is too much work for the average voter.

In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden.</p>\n<p>One thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked.

				"content_text": "A few weeks ago I read [The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) by Mike Caulfield and it really resonated with me. In my mind almost all of what I write on the web is part of my own garden, even though I do that writing using blogging tools that are more stream than garden. \n\nOne thing that I would add to idea of a garden or stream is structure. I personally like drilling down into a topic, which is why ever since I first experienced hyperlinks and the web it clicked. My affinity toward structure is also why I find outlines appealing. \n\nChronology (reverse), archives, and permalinks are structures of blogs that I think distinguish it technologically from \"regular\" web sites. The informal personal voice of blogs is what distinguishes the blog writing style from other writing styles you see on the web.\n\nAnd yet, blogs writing is also point in time. One writes a blog post, it enters the stream, and beyond perhaps that first day one rarely, if ever, edits or adds to a blog post. \n\nThe ongoing revision of a piece of writing is fundamentally what I think Caulfield means by \"the garden.\" With that paradigm, I created two \"projects\", the first being a web page in which I originally wrote about [which Chromebook I was going to buy](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html) and then continually revised that page as I learned more up until I made my decision.

I got that computer because it was cheap enough for my grandmother to buy, and she somehow determined back then that computers where the future. \n\nOne of the unique things about the TS1000 is that it had a membrane keyboard and each key had multiple functions, most notably certain function key combinations produced BASIC reserve words geared towards making it easy to learn how to program. The TS1000's keyboard could be seen today as a predecessor to today's on-screen keyboards. \n\nBack in the 80s and early 90s all personal computers came with an operating system and the BASIC programming language.
