When they wrote that all men were created equal, they assumed it understood that meant white, male, property owners and not others.

What we are experiencing in the United States today is a continuation of how it has always been in the United States, the difference now is that the oligarchs have become so confident that they no longer care to continue pretending that there is actual democracy. The oligarchs have been able to convince a majority of the citizens of the United States that their aims align with the oligarchs, it is the realization of the &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->trickle down<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; ideology that Ronald Reagan preached.</p>\n<p>The Declaration of Independence has always hidden the prime question of civilization in plain sight.  When <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jefferson wrote<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The question is, liberty for whom?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Truth is, the norm of civilization on the Earth, which over time has been called different things but which can be simply stated as empire, has never allowed for liberty of everyone. Over the course of history different forms of government have existed and even those that claim to be democracies institute class hierarchies that provide liberty for some at the expense of others. Governments are institutions of humans and reflect our human dualistic view of the world. Governments are necessary and not particularly bad, but humans need to be self aware of our instincts and vigilant at guarding against them.</p>\n<p>I believe the form of democracy in the United States as intended to exist through purpose, not the literal words, of the U.S. Constitution is as good a government that can provide liberty for everyone as any in the world, so long as citizens push back against our habit of seeing ourselves as better than and apart from our neighbor. I think such vigilance takes the form of placing core values above all others.</p>\n<p>One such core value is what does liberty mean? You can <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look up the word liberty in a dictionary<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and you will find several descriptions of what one may think of as freedom, but for me liberty boils down to my control over my body, which is exercised in many different ways such as to do as I please, to be free from restraint, and to decide what does and does not happen to my body.  A Supreme Court that is unwilling to recognize that liberty, which is intended to be enshrined by our founding documents, extends to women&rsquo;s right to decide what happens to their body is violating the core value of liberty.</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights defines other core values, but perhaps one most overlooked but closely related to liberty is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Ninth Amendment<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that states that it is the citizens who claim our rights and not only the Constitution.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Constitution does not deny the rights retained by the people. Is a Supreme Court, or for that matter any member of Congress or President of the United States, that does not seem to know the definition of liberty or seeks to deny rights retained by the people acting in the best interests of the people as their representatives or are they acting in the best interests of their oligarch class?</p>\n<p>It is true that the founders, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like Plato<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, were not fond of pure democracy and thus created a republic as a representative form of democracy. The founders were also not fond of the authority of the monarchy they just fought a war against, and so they created a system of government intended to preserve the best features of democracy while preventing against  tyrannies be they of individuals or classes. Among but not limited to these features are the unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (Note the similarity between the Declaration and the Ninth Amendment) Beware of attempts to throw out democracy in the bathwater for that is language the political party oligarchs use to claim liberty for themselves at the expense of others. Let us be vigilant for that more perfect union that Madison wrote in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Preamble of the U.S. Constitution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>",

If one takes a honest look back at the history of the United States you will see that it has always been an <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/oligarchy\">oligarchy</a> rather than a democracy. \n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe founders intended our government to be a republic, a representative democracy, rather than a pure democracy, that would prevent tyranny, but their intentions were thwarted as soon <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/past-projects/quotes/article/however-political-parties-may-now-and-then-answer-popular-ends-they-are-likely-in-the-course-of-time-and-things-to-become-potent-engines-by-which-cunning-ambitious-and-unprincipled-men-will-be-enabled-to-subvert-the-power-of-the-people-and-to-usurp-for-th/\">as political parties arose to control/influence our representatives</a>. Go back and look at the definition of oligarchy and consider whether political parties are nothing but classes of people who see the power of government vested in themselves.\n\nPolitical parties are to democracy what monopolies are to capitalism, both corrupt the founding principles of their institutions, and those who enjoy the privileges of the power these oligarchies provide do everything they can to preserve those privileges.  \n\nConsider the wealth of the founding fathers, most of whom were white, male, property owners. <a href=\"https://www.mountvernon.org/\">Washington</a> and <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/\">Jefferson</a> owned plantations. When they wrote that all men were created equal, they assumed it understood that meant white, male, property owners and not others. The American Revolution was a war for white, male property owners to keep their wealth from the King of England.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://billofrightsinstitute.org/would-you-have-been-a-federalist-or-an-anti-federalist\">Federalists vs Anti-Federalists debates</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theusconstitution.org/news/understanding-the-three-fifths-compromise/\">Three-Fifths Compromise</a> and associated <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-founding-fathers-constitutional-convention\">Electoral College</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War\">Civil War</a>, <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/the-fight-for-womens-suffrage\">Women's Suffrage</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/jim-crow-laws\">Jim Crow Laws</a> were all moments when the true nature of the founding of the Unites States was exposed.  What we are experiencing in the United States today is a continuation of how it has always been in the United States, the difference now is that the oligarchs have become so confident that they no longer care to continue pretending that there is actual democracy. The oligarchs have been able to convince a majority of the citizens of the United States that their aims align with the oligarchs, it is the realization of the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics\">trickle down</a>\" ideology that Ronald Reagan preached.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence has always hidden the prime question of civilization in plain sight.  When <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcript\">Jefferson wrote</a>:\n\n>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \n\n<b>The question is, liberty for whom?</b>  \n\nTruth is, the norm of civilization on the Earth, which over time has been called different things but which can be simply stated as empire, has never allowed for liberty of everyone. Over the course of history different forms of government have existed and even those that claim to be democracies institute class hierarchies that provide liberty for some at the expense of others. Governments are institutions of humans and reflect our human dualistic view of the world. Governments are necessary and not particularly bad, but humans need to be self aware of our instincts and vigilant at guarding against them. \n\nI believe the form of democracy in the United States as intended to exist through purpose, not the literal words, of the U.S. Constitution is as good a government that can provide liberty for everyone as any in the world, so long as citizens push back against our habit of seeing ourselves as better than and apart from our neighbor. I think such vigilance takes the form of placing core values above all others. \n\nOne such core value is what does liberty mean? You can <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liberty\">look up the word liberty in a dictionary</a> and you will find several descriptions of what one may think of as freedom, but for me liberty boils down to my control over my body, which is exercised in many different ways such as to do as I please, to be free from restraint, and to decide what does and does not happen to my body.  A Supreme Court that is unwilling to recognize that liberty, which is intended to be enshrined by our founding documents, extends to women's right to decide what happens to their body is violating the core value of liberty. \n\nThe Bill of Rights defines other core values, but perhaps one most overlooked but closely related to liberty is <a href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-9/\">the Ninth Amendment</a> that states that it is the citizens who claim our rights and not only the Constitution. \n\n>The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\n\nThe Constitution does not deny the rights retained by the people. Is a Supreme Court, or for that matter any member of Congress or President of the United States, that does not seem to know the definition of liberty or seeks to deny rights retained by the people acting in the best interests of the people as their representatives or are they acting in the best interests of their oligarch class? \n\nIt is true that the founders, <a href=\"https://www.nypl.org/blog/2020/06/15/liberty-and-justice-all-platos-condemnation-democracy\">like Plato</a>, were not fond of pure democracy and thus created a republic as a representative form of democracy. The founders were also not fond of the authority of the monarchy they just fought a war against, and so they created a system of government intended to preserve the best features of democracy while preventing against  tyrannies be they of individuals or classes. Among but not limited to these features are the unalienable Rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. (Note the similarity between the Declaration and the Ninth Amendment) Beware of attempts to throw out democracy in the bathwater for that is language the political party oligarchs use to claim liberty for themselves at the expense of others. Let us be vigilant for that more perfect union that Madison wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/us\">Preamble of the U.S. Constitution</a>.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GM announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that it is moving its headquarters from <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Renaissance Center<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to the new Hudson building next year. The announcement has me feeling sad.  I moved to the Detroit area in 1989 to start my career with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Electronic Data Systems<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (EDS), which then was a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors. I could have worked at any one of dozens of offices in the Detroit area that EDS or GM occupied, but my job was located at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the General Motors Building<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, now known as Cadillac Place, a beautiful building designed by architect <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Albert Kahn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and constructed in the early 1920s. Every work day for two years I walked through the architectural marvels that are the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fisher<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and GM Buildings.</p>\n<p>In 1995 GM spun off EDS into an independent company and to complete that spin off EDS paid GM $500 million. A year later GM announced it was buying the Renaissance Center for $73 million and moving their headquarters to that building. I remember watching the announcement GM made to their employees that featured an animation of a helicopter placing the GM logo on the top of the RenCen tower. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Six  years later EDS announced<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it was consolidating some of its Detroit offices, all used in support of GM, into Tower 500 of the Renaissance Center, and a few years after that I moved into a brand new cube in the newly renovated tower.</p>\n<p>Detroit today looks very different than it did back in 1996, back then the Detroit riverfront as mostly discarded properly with piles of dirt or dirt parking lots. Today a beautiful walking path stretches from Belle Isle south by about five miles, connecting a few new parks along the way. The difference one sees in Detroit today can be traced back to GM&rsquo;s purchase of the Renaissance Center and the millions of dollars it spent to revitalize the riverfront area. I am certain that without the investment that GM made Dan Gilbert would not have been as interested to make the investments in Detroit that lead to the new tower on the Hudson site.</p>\n<p>I very much enjoyed my years working at the Renaissance Center, although the commute that could stretch for more than an hour if there were an accident, not so much. Whenever there was an event, like the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Super Bowl<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Red Bull air races<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, or when there were parades for the Detroit Red Wings or Pistons championships, the RenCen was energetic.</p>\n<p>The announcement yesterday did not include any information about the future of the RenCen.

				"content_text": "Yesterday <a href=\"https://www.autoblog.com/2024/04/15/gm-reportedly-moving-out-of-its-detroit-headquarters-towers/\">GM announced</a> that it is moving its headquarters from <a href=\"https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/renaissance-center\">the Renaissance Center</a> to the new Hudson building next year. The announcement has me feeling sad.  I moved to the Detroit area in 1989 to start my career with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Data_Systems\">Electronic Data Systems</a> (EDS), which then was a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors. I could have worked at any one of dozens of offices in the Detroit area that EDS or GM occupied, but my job was located at <a href=\"https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/general-motors-buildingcadillac-place\">the General Motors Building</a>, now known as Cadillac Place, a beautiful building designed by architect <a href=\"https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/kahn-albert\">Albert Kahn</a> and constructed in the early 1920s. Every work day for two years I walked through the architectural marvels that are the <a href=\"https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/fisher-building\">Fisher</a> and GM Buildings.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIn 1995 GM spun off EDS into an independent company and to complete that spin off EDS paid GM $500 million. A year later GM announced it was buying the Renaissance Center for $73 million and moving their headquarters to that building. I remember watching the announcement GM made to their employees that featured an animation of a helicopter placing the GM logo on the top of the RenCen tower. <a href=\"https://www.globest.com/sites/globest/2002/11/14/it-giant-picks-rencens-tower-500-for-new-digs/?slreturn=20240316095726\">Six  years later EDS announced</a> it was consolidating some of its Detroit offices, all used in support of GM, into Tower 500 of the Renaissance Center, and a few years after that I moved into a brand new cube in the newly renovated tower.\n\nDetroit today looks very different than it did back in 1996, back then the Detroit riverfront as mostly discarded properly with piles of dirt or dirt parking lots. Today a beautiful walking path stretches from Belle Isle south by about five miles, connecting a few new parks along the way. The difference one sees in Detroit today can be traced back to GM's purchase of the Renaissance Center and the millions of dollars it spent to revitalize the riverfront area. I am certain that without the investment that GM made Dan Gilbert would not have been as interested to make the investments in Detroit that lead to the new tower on the Hudson site. \n\nI very much enjoyed my years working at the Renaissance Center, although the commute that could stretch for more than an hour if there were an accident, not so much. Whenever there was an event, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL\">Super Bowl</a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4EzUv0TJbI\">Red Bull air races</a>, or when there were parades for the Detroit Red Wings or Pistons championships, the RenCen was energetic. \n\nThe announcement yesterday did not include any information about the future of the RenCen. While GM and its subsidiaries occupied nearly the whole of all four office towers, that began to decrease over time either through head count reductions or by GM's sale/spinoff of GMAC/Ally Finanicial that moved to another office building in Detroit. During my time working at the RenCen EDS went from occupying all 13 floors of Tower 500 to slowing emptying out floors of that building and ultimately ending up in two floors of Tower 100, and at that time EDS was again acquired, this time by Hewlett Packard. We eventually moved from the Renaissance Center to an entire office building in Pontiac until 2018 when the landlord of that build sold it and the now DXC Technology moved to two floors in building in Auburn Hills.\n\nIt is hard to imagine the Renaissance Center being torn down because it is so iconic, but at the same time it is hard to imagine that much office space being occupied. Perhaps the center (tallest) tower can be renovated into a mix of hotel and loft/condos, but it is hard to imagine all four towers being occupied in such a manner.

				"content_html": "<p>The Chicago Cubs have completed the 2024 Cactus League spring training &ldquo;season&rdquo; and will start the 2024 MLB season tomorrow at the Texas Rangers. As many questions exist about the 2024 team as did for the 2023 team, so it is hard for me to expect them to be too much better than last year. Will Greg Counsell as the new manager make a difference?

The thing is, due to its multi-ethnic and multi-cultural founding, the United States has been unique in reliance on principals/values for existence. Freedom, liberty, or democracy, however you want to think of them are values that are de-valued when the ends justify the means. Consequently, the United States no longer strives for the ideals upon which it was founded and therefore will revert to the state to which it began. \n",

In fact, I am pretty sure that I first used a beta version of the product perhaps as early as 2005. At the time it was introduced no company was really developing notetaking software, at least not for Windows. When first introduced the UI of EverNote had the form of a continual scroll of information &ldquo;flagged&rdquo; by date, in fact it could be my first experience with the newsfeed/stream UI now commonly used by social networking applications.</p>\n<p>The closest resemblance EverNote had to any other product was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the UI of the Newton OS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that ran on Apple&rsquo;s Newton Messagepad.  The resemblance may have been intentional because EverNote was founded by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stepan Pachikov<!-- raw HTML omitted --> who with his company Paragraph International, lead the development of the handwriting recognition engine known as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CalliGrapher<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which was licensed by Apple for use with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Newton OS<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. EverNote&rsquo;s resemblance to Newton definitely drew my attention to the product.</p>\n<p>Pachikov brought <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phil Libin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> onboard as CEO of Evernote (originally the product name had a capitalized N that was changed to lowercase by 2008) and Libin grew the company and the product into the well recognized, multi-platform product that most people know of it today. In my opinion what made Evernote attractive is that it centrally stored data (perhaps one of the first commercial client/server applications) that is accessible to client applications running on nearly every computing platform that I use. At a time when it was common to see applications that ran only on Mac or Windows, or iOS, Evernote ran any every single one of these platforms.</p>\n<p>Of course, developing and then maintaining separate code bases for each platform is daunting, particularly if the application architecture was not explicitly developed for that use, and so over time bugs crept up that caused problems. The relatively fast growth of the product also lead to performance issues, and for some data loss.  For me Evernote <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jumped the shark<!-- raw HTML omitted --> around 2013 when the company began licensing/selling products with Evernote branding, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like socks<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that had no relationship to the core product, while there were significant problems with the Evernote app. One year after Libin left Evernote the company stopped selling these products.</p>\n<p>It might be said that Evernote began its path of decent soon after Libin left the company in 2015. Key developers started to leave the company and  soon there  seemed to be yearly rumors of the company going under. While many who I associated with stopped using it, by 2015 I had accumulated seven years of information in the application and I felt the yearly $60 subscription was worth my continued access to that information from all the devices I use. The Evernote web clipper had become my most valued tool of all the software I use and it is still the best browser web clipping application available particularly on mobile devices. Unlike most other apps, sharing to Evernote on iOS and Android captures the entire web page rather than just the link to the page.</p>\n<p>So, despite the dismal outlook for the company and the app, I stayed committed to it, but last year it was acquired by Bending Spoons and they changed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the subscription cost to $15 per month<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which I decided was too expensive in light of what I pay in other software subscriptions. When the rumors of the demise of Evernote started appearing I began testing ways to export my information out of the application and import it into others. Two years ago I exported everything from Evernote to OneNote, which wasn&rsquo;t perfect but good enough for me to find information should I need to. Last year I found I could also import my Evernote archive into Obsidian, which I completed last fall and from that point stopped storing new information in Evernote.</p>\n<p>My yearly subscription with Evernote renews at the end of January, so my deadline to delete my data from Evernote and close my account was this past weekend. Deleting my notes was much more laborious than I would have preferred, as a deleted note is moved to Trash and then one has to empty the Trash in order to completely delete the note and I found that Trash emptying seemed to only handle about 100 notes or so at a time, particularly with the web application. The problem seems to be with the synchronization performance, even the web app syncs data with the browser local storage, and I suspect there is Javasript handling all of the API calls to tell Evernote&rsquo;s servers to move and delete data.</p>\n<p>I am obviously much more brand loyal than most other people, so it&rsquo;s really a big deal for me personally to stop using a product after having used it for more than ten years. Obviously, my issue is not with the product itself but the subscription cost that most likely is driven by a decreasing number of subscribers. I do expect Evernote to eventually disappear within the next year or two. Going forward I am using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joplin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to capture web clippings from Mac and Linux, tolerating the fact that sharing to Joplin with iPad only captures the link and not the web content. I have also started using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Archivebox<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my home network. I am using end to end encryption with Joplin and using OneDrive as the &ldquo;hub&rdquo; for storing/syncing the data in Joplin between my desktops and iPad. Unfortunately the Android version of Joplin does not synchronize well and I gave up even trying to use it on my Pixel 7a.</p>\n",

The Evernote web clipper had become my most valued tool of all the software I use and it is still the best browser web clipping application available particularly on mobile devices. Unlike most other apps, sharing to Evernote on iOS and Android captures the entire web page rather than just the link to the page. \n\nSo, despite the dismal outlook for the company and the app, I stayed committed to it, but last year it was acquired by Bending Spoons and they changed <a href=\"https://evernote.com/compare-plans\">the subscription cost to $15 per month</a>, which I decided was too expensive in light of what I pay in other software subscriptions. When the rumors of the demise of Evernote started appearing I began testing ways to export my information out of the application and import it into others. Two years ago I exported everything from Evernote to OneNote, which wasn't perfect but good enough for me to find information should I need to. Last year I found I could also import my Evernote archive into Obsidian, which I completed last fall and from that point stopped storing new information in Evernote. \n\nMy yearly subscription with Evernote renews at the end of January, so my deadline to delete my data from Evernote and close my account was this past weekend. Deleting my notes was much more laborious than I would have preferred, as a deleted note is moved to Trash and then one has to empty the Trash in order to completely delete the note and I found that Trash emptying seemed to only handle about 100 notes or so at a time, particularly with the web application. The problem seems to be with the synchronization performance, even the web app syncs data with the browser local storage, and I suspect there is Javasript handling all of the API calls to tell Evernote's servers to move and delete data. \n\nI am obviously much more brand loyal than most other people, so it's really a big deal for me personally to stop using a product after having used it for more than ten years. Obviously, my issue is not with the product itself but the subscription cost that most likely is driven by a decreasing number of subscribers. I do expect Evernote to eventually disappear within the next year or two. Going forward I am using <a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/help/\">Joplin</a> to capture web clippings from Mac and Linux, tolerating the fact that sharing to Joplin with iPad only captures the link and not the web content. I have also started using <a href=\"https://archivebox.io/\">Archivebox</a> on my home network. I am using end to end encryption with Joplin and using OneDrive as the \"hub\" for storing/syncing the data in Joplin between my desktops and iPad. Unfortunately the Android version of Joplin does not synchronize well and I gave up even trying to use it on my Pixel 7a.\n",

				"title": "Just Looking In The Rear View Mirror",
				"content_html": "<p>From the perspective of my life time of 1966 to present, I think the most consequential change on society has been the rise of conservatism. Today many people claim themselves to be conservative while not being clear what they mean. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wikipedia<!-- raw HTML omitted --> defines conservatism as &ldquo;a cultural, social, and political philosophy that seeks to promote and to preserve traditional institutions, customs, and values.&rdquo; How conservatism is practiced varies among societies.</p>\n<p>At the risk of over simplifying, I think Americans who claim to be conservatives mean they are for smaller government, translated to mean lower taxes, lower government spending, and less government involvement in their daily lives. Recently  I think the label has simplified to just mean, not liberal, or &ldquo;Trump supporter.&rdquo;  While some want simply to be left alone and have more agency over their lives, many want to return to some time in the past, such as during the 1950s, when they believed life was better.</p>\n<p>I believe conservatives and liberals have an unhealthy obsession with the past. Conservatives want to return to the past, liberals want to correct the past and it seems neither understand that the value of history is to learn from the past for the purpose of not repeating mistakes in the future. I think it is ironic that conservatives and liberals are seen as polar opposites while in reality both are obsessed with the past and neither side has a healthy perspective on progress. In short, you can&rsquo;t really make progress when you are constantly looking in the rear view mirror.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Can you think of any area of politics that is not about the past? From the age of our government leaders, to how the U.S. constitution is currently used, to why there are wars, to why we cannot decrease the number of mass shootings, work to improve the climate and become healthier, every one of these are only really viewed from the perspective of the past. If most people agree that we should do something about these things, why can&rsquo;t we?</p>\n<p>The current obsession with polarization means more interest is in the argument rather than progress. I am not sure either side really wants progress because whenever either one has the ability to make progress disagreements within their ranks prevents it from happening. Polarization is focused on getting one&rsquo;s way and beating the other and lost is any amount progress that in past times was born out of debate between the two points of view.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to have different ideas for how progress is to be made, or even what is progress, and another to not want to progress at all. Right now the United States has no desire for progress, we see this in how everything of significance is being handled in the world.

				"content_text": "From the perspective of my life time of 1966 to present, I think the most consequential change on society has been the rise of conservatism. Today many people claim themselves to be conservative while not being clear what they mean. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism#:~:text=Conservatism%20is%20a%20cultural%2C%20social,civilization%20in%20which%20it%20appears.\">Wikipedia</a> defines conservatism as \"a cultural, social, and political philosophy that seeks to promote and to preserve traditional institutions, customs, and values.\" How conservatism is practiced varies among societies.\n\nAt the risk of over simplifying, I think Americans who claim to be conservatives mean they are for smaller government, translated to mean lower taxes, lower government spending, and less government involvement in their daily lives. Recently  I think the label has simplified to just mean, not liberal, or \"Trump supporter.\"  While some want simply to be left alone and have more agency over their lives, many want to return to some time in the past, such as during the 1950s, when they believed life was better.\n\nI believe conservatives and liberals have an unhealthy obsession with the past. Conservatives want to return to the past, liberals want to correct the past and it seems neither understand that the value of history is to learn from the past for the purpose of not repeating mistakes in the future. I think it is ironic that conservatives and liberals are seen as polar opposites while in reality both are obsessed with the past and neither side has a healthy perspective on progress. In short, you can't really make progress when you are constantly looking in the rear view mirror. \n\nDon't believe me? Can you think of any area of politics that is not about the past? From the age of our government leaders, to how the U.S. constitution is currently used, to why there are wars, to why we cannot decrease the number of mass shootings, work to improve the climate and become healthier, every one of these are only really viewed from the perspective of the past. If most people agree that we should do something about these things, why can't we? \n\nThe current obsession with polarization means more interest is in the argument rather than progress. I am not sure either side really wants progress because whenever either one has the ability to make progress disagreements within their ranks prevents it from happening. Polarization is focused on getting one's way and beating the other and lost is any amount progress that in past times was born out of debate between the two points of view.\n\nIt's one thing to have different ideas for how progress is to be made, or even what is progress, and another to not want to progress at all. Right now the United States has no desire for progress, we see this in how everything of significance is being handled in the world. I think how we got here is born out of a belief, more shared than we like to realize, that humanity cannot really improve itself. Too many now think the world cannot be better for future generations so it's not even worth trying. So long American dream. No wonder why Gen Z is pissed of at all older generations and considers everything they say as b.s., and we are seeing the consequences playing out. \n\nConsequently, why bother with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@dennis.saw/on-the-breakdown-of-empathy-1e47a0199a96\">empathy</a>? I don't need to consider how events affect you, the other, when I know how they affect me. Without empathy there is no way to love my neighbor, nor see my neighbor as a part of myself, I only need to know the world through my own feelings and state of being.  In fact, they aren't neighbors, most are enemies. No need to imagine a better world and the hope that inspires, rather one's imagination only produces nightmares. \n\nHumanity is driving itself toward extinction, what only seems open to debate is how, destruction incrementally via climate change, or suddenly via nuclear war?  It always has taken work and the desire to co-exist with and even love the other with whom we share space with on this planet. What is certain is destruction will happen while we are only looking in the rear view mirror and not through the windshield toward the future.

				"content_html": "<p>The World Series, like most major sports championships, is won by defense. In baseball that mainly translates to pitching, but also fielding. When you play the same team in a playoff series your hitters usually face the opponent&rsquo;s best pitching, consequently you should plan for 3 or fewer runs scored and that means you want your pitching to hold the opponent to 3 or fewer runs.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of September the Cubs have been in playoff games. Nearly all of the teams they faced need to beat them to move ahead of the Cubs in the Wild Card playoff standings. By my count the Cubs have played 17 games so far in September and in 7 of them their opponent scored 3 or fewer runs. My conclusion is that the Cubs pitching is simply not good enough to win in the playoffs.</p>\n<p>I think my conclusion holds if you look at the larger body of work over the season. I expect that in a high percentage of the games the Cubs won they scored 4 or more runs, too many of those they needed to score 4 or more runs. During the regular season it is not surprising that your hitters will have more success because they will be in many situations where they face poor pitching.</p>\n<p>A team built to win in the MLB playoffs has the pitching that more often than not can hold their opponent to 3 or fewer runs. Truth is the Cubs got through the 2023 season with only one reliable starting pitcher, maybe two (Steele for sure, and possibly Hendricks). Stroman and Taillon have not been consistent and Taillon has been aweful. Javier Assad joined the starting rotation too late in to the season so it is really hard to assess his reliability. The bullpen is no better, only Merrywather and Alzolay has been reliable, though Leiter is borderline.</p>\n<p>The fact that the Cubs are in a playoff race is much more important this year than they actually make the playoffs, and the goal long term is be winning division championships and not gain a playoff berth via the wild card. While at the beginning of the season there was some hope the Cubs could compete with the Brewers for the NL Central division championship, I think it was evident early on through head to head games with the Brewers that this Cubs team is not as good or better than the Brewers. Sure, the Cubs can win any game, but can they win a series?</p>\n<p>Bottom line, the Chicago Cubs are on schedule for their long term goals of winning division titles and the World Series in upcoming years. Clearly, the Cubs need to improve their pitching. Jordan Wicks has shown he is a piece of the puzzle for next year, and we can hope Taillon will return to the how he pitched in the past. Stroman might be back, but with Hendricks being another year older I think the Cubs need to sign at least two reliable starting pitchers during the off season as well as keep Merryweather.</p>\n<p>From the lineup perspective, I think the Cubs should be aggressive in their attempt to sign Bellinger, but I doubt he stays and his departure will create a big gap in their lineup. Maybe youngsters Morel, Mervis, or Crow-Armstrong can help fill that gap but all are too inexperienced with MLB pitching. Consequently, the Cubs need to sign at least one big-name hitter to maintain their current starting lineup performance.</p>\n<p>Finally, the biggest question of the off season might be whether David Ross has what it takes to manage a championship caliber baseball team. Every manager makes questionable lineup and in-game decisions, and this is Ross' first manager job so we need to keep in mind that he is learning on the job. I personally can&rsquo;t pin the current Cubs situation on Ross, the bottom line is that the players have to perform and they are not performing. Ross has made lineup changes and pitching changes, as far as I can tell he is doing everything he can to try and have the Cubs win games. I would not be in a hurry to replace Ross unless there is a championship experienced person to replace him.

In the big picture I am happy about where the Cubs are, they met my expectations for this season and look to be on track of near year and beyond.

				"title": "Time For The Chicago Cubs To Embrace The Pressure",
				"content_html": "<p>The 162 game schedule is a big part of what makes Major League Baseball unique among professional sports in the United States because it tends to force differences in how games are approached throughout the season. No team is ever going to be undefeated, the current best team, the Atlanta Braves, has won a little over 65% of their games. The MLB season is a marathon meaning that in most cases a game is not treated as &ldquo;must win.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Oddly, while a long schedule means most games are not &ldquo;must win,&rdquo; for some teams, earlier than they would like, the season transitions to &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they win or lose&rdquo; because they are out of playoff contention. As a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan it has been my experience more often than not that the Cubs are out of playoff contention by the end of May or early June. Further, as a lifelong Cubs fan, I have learned it is much more fun watching games year after year when the team is playing meaningful games in September. I would much rather have the team lose in the playoffs every year than have the team out the playoffs by June in the majority of seasons.</p>\n<p>So, in baseball, a transition occurs over the course of a season where teams move from playing to win games to playing to must win games. The benefit of expanding the number of playoff teams is that more teams start playing more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games in September than in years past. In my experience, teams with players who have the most experience winning &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games are best positioned for long term success.</p>\n<p>As an aside, it should be obvious why wild card teams, which have worse records than division winners, have had so much success in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s because they usually play more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games during the last month of the season and through that gain valuable experience and confidence. Turns out there is a big difference between &ldquo;wanting to win&rdquo; and &ldquo;needing to win.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At this point of a long 2023 season, the Chicago Cubs are starting the transition in to &ldquo;must win&rdquo; territory. Nobody associated with the Cubs is going to admit publicly that the games they are playing this week and next are must win, but it&rsquo;s a mistake if they don&rsquo;t start viewing the games as such, in fact they ought to embrace the transition. As Billy Jean King is often <!-- raw HTML omitted -->quoted as saying<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &ldquo;Pressure is a privilege.&rdquo; The pressure of being in &ldquo;must win&rdquo; mode as the calendar flips from August to September is a badge of success.</p>\n<p>The unpredictable nature of sports mean should the Cubs make the playoffs they could win the World Series. The probability of the 2023 Cubs winning the World Series is not high, not like it was for the 2016 team. However, the experience of playing as many &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games as possible over the course of the final month of the season is huge!

				"content_text": "The 162 game schedule is a big part of what makes Major League Baseball unique among professional sports in the United States because it tends to force differences in how games are approached throughout the season. No team is ever going to be undefeated, the current best team, the Atlanta Braves, has won a little over 65% of their games. The MLB season is a marathon meaning that in most cases a game is not treated as \"must win.\" \n\nOddly, while a long schedule means most games are not \"must win,\" for some teams, earlier than they would like, the season transitions to \"it doesn't matter whether they win or lose\" because they are out of playoff contention. As a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan it has been my experience more often than not that the Cubs are out of playoff contention by the end of May or early June. Further, as a lifelong Cubs fan, I have learned it is much more fun watching games year after year when the team is playing meaningful games in September. I would much rather have the team lose in the playoffs every year than have the team out the playoffs by June in the majority of seasons.\n\nSo, in baseball, a transition occurs over the course of a season where teams move from playing to win games to playing to must win games. The benefit of expanding the number of playoff teams is that more teams start playing more \"must win\" games in September than in years past. In my experience, teams with players who have the most experience winning \"must win\" games are best positioned for long term success. \n\nAs an aside, it should be obvious why wild card teams, which have worse records than division winners, have had so much success in the playoffs, it's because they usually play more \"must win\" games during the last month of the season and through that gain valuable experience and confidence. Turns out there is a big difference between \"wanting to win\" and \"needing to win.\" \n\nAt this point of a long 2023 season, the Chicago Cubs are starting the transition in to \"must win\" territory. Nobody associated with the Cubs is going to admit publicly that the games they are playing this week and next are must win, but it's a mistake if they don't start viewing the games as such, in fact they ought to embrace the transition. As Billy Jean King is often <a href=\"https://www.azquotes.com/quote/621788\">quoted as saying</a>, \"Pressure is a privilege.\" The pressure of being in \"must win\" mode as the calendar flips from August to September is a badge of success. \n\nThe unpredictable nature of sports mean should the Cubs make the playoffs they could win the World Series. The probability of the 2023 Cubs winning the World Series is not high, not like it was for the 2016 team. However, the experience of playing as many \"must win\" games as possible over the course of the final month of the season is huge! The Cubs are exactly where they hoped to be at this time of the season and now players who have not had the experience with this type of pressure gain the experience that will provide dividends for years beyond. \n\nI was mad the Cubs were crushed by the Brewers last night because I desire the immediate gratification of winning the N.L. Central this year, but I am happy that the young Cubs players such as their current best starting pitcher, Justin Steele, are getting this experience playing these games. However, the full value of that experience will not be realized if the team, from top to bottom, doesn't consider these games \"must win.\" \n\nThe 2023 MLB Season is transitioning from \"would like to win\" to \"must win\" for the Cubs, and I am looking for the team to embrace the pressure.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I am resigned to the fact that Chicago Cubs are not going to be a playoff team this year, which makes them sellers for the upcoming trade deadline, and it is this idea of &ldquo;selling&rdquo; that makes me mad. We knew that Cody Bellinger was only going to be with the Cubs for a year and if he played to any amount of his capability would be a mid season trade, so his leaving is not a problem. What I don&rsquo;t want to see is the Cubs trading Marcus Stroman.</p>\n<p>Starting pitching is the foundation of a MLB team and the Cubs have no real pitching prospects in their farm system. Every free agent pitcher not on their team that the Cubs sign is an unknown. Jameson Taillon is the most recent case in point, the Cubs didn&rsquo;t really know what they were getting when they signed Taillon but they hoped he would be as good as he was in previous seasons. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you sign a player not on your team you hope they will perform as you expect, but hope is not a strategy! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Stroman has been the best Cubs pitcher the last two years. You can make the claim he is one of the best pitchers in baseball and the Cubs should know best about his health, his mental make up, and his skills. In other words, Stroman is a known asset, and when you are building a team I think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->general managers should bias what they know about the players on their team<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>\n<p>If the Cubs trade Stroman, to me that not only means this season (2023) is down the drain, it is also that they are not closer to making the playoffs in 2024. What such a trade tells me is that the Cubs continue to tread mediocrity and have no real plan for returning to the playoffs. Further, if the Cubs trade Stroman and thus are sellers at the deadline ownership must make a change in the front office and the manager. I don&rsquo;t think Hoyer has any real idea how to build the team, he is just hoping to improve, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hope is not a plan.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>The &ldquo;buyers and sellers&rdquo; phenomenon is not good for Major League Baseball. The way teams treat free agency is destroying how they build their teams and farm systems for continued success.

				"content_text": "I am resigned to the fact that Chicago Cubs are not going to be a playoff team this year, which makes them sellers for the upcoming trade deadline, and it is this idea of \"selling\" that makes me mad. We knew that Cody Bellinger was only going to be with the Cubs for a year and if he played to any amount of his capability would be a mid season trade, so his leaving is not a problem. What I don't want to see is the Cubs trading Marcus Stroman. \n\nStarting pitching is the foundation of a MLB team and the Cubs have no real pitching prospects in their farm system. Every free agent pitcher not on their team that the Cubs sign is an unknown. Jameson Taillon is the most recent case in point, the Cubs didn't really know what they were getting when they signed Taillon but they hoped he would be as good as he was in previous seasons. <b>When you sign a player not on your team you hope they will perform as you expect, but hope is not a strategy! </b>\n\nStroman has been the best Cubs pitcher the last two years. You can make the claim he is one of the best pitchers in baseball and the Cubs should know best about his health, his mental make up, and his skills. In other words, Stroman is a known asset, and when you are building a team I think <b>general managers should bias what they know about the players on their team</b>.\n\nIf the Cubs trade Stroman, to me that not only means this season (2023) is down the drain, it is also that they are not closer to making the playoffs in 2024. What such a trade tells me is that the Cubs continue to tread mediocrity and have no real plan for returning to the playoffs. Further, if the Cubs trade Stroman and thus are sellers at the deadline ownership must make a change in the front office and the manager. I don't think Hoyer has any real idea how to build the team, he is just hoping to improve, and <b>hope is not a plan.</b> \n\nThe \"buyers and sellers\" phenomenon is not good for Major League Baseball. The way teams treat free agency is destroying how they build their teams and farm systems for continued success. Now, because most teams in baseball are not very good, most teams are unloading their best players mid season for prospects that might never make it to the majors or at best won't be on their team until 3 years down the road. Every off season teams buy a bunch of free agents (basically creating new rosters every year), all who are unknowns, and hope they perform well enough to form a competitive team. Most teams find their hopes were ill conceived and they rinse and repeat.  \n\nPut it another way, <b>nearly all MLB general managers are doing their job no differently than fantasy baseball managers</b>. Problem is, fantasy baseball is not the real world. MLB does not build rosters based on a draft of the entire pool of available players. <b>Right now the Cubs, and most MLB teams, are building new rosters each year from a small pool of unknowns</b>.

				"content_html": "<p>Google announced and began selling <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Pixel 7a<!-- raw HTML omitted --> earlier last month, and I ordered a Sea colored version from Amazon about a week later. The Pixel 7a is replacing the Pixel 4a that has been my everyday carry phone for the last three years. I really like the size and feel of the Pixel 4a and so I was not eager to up-size to the newer phone, but it has come to the end of the road with Android and there are features the 7a has that make the upgrade a &ldquo;no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>My main concern about the Pixel 7a has been its size and glossy back. The Pixel 7a is taller than the Pixel 4a and because of that I find it harder to operate with one hand. The weight, however, is the most noticeable difference. I am finding that due to the weight it is more comfortable holding the phone in my left hand, but in a position where I can&rsquo;t scroll apps with that same hand and as a result this phone requires more two hand operation than the Pixel 4a. The weight and size difference is also noticeable when I put the Pixel 7a in a front pant pocket. Fortunately, the size do not make these use cases impossible, just different and I suspect the difference will become less noticeable over time.</p>\n<p>The back of the Pixel 7a is more &ldquo;polished&rdquo; than the Pixel 4a, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel so slippery that I fear it is going to quickly slip out of my hand. I purchased a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really nice Latercase<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone.</p>\n<p>Battery life appears to be better, but I don&rsquo;t know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Accubattery<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%. Battery life is an item that requires a longer duration to evaluate.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is just me, but I think pictures using the wide angle lens have a bit of a fish eye affect. (See the last picture on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this page<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for an example.) I don&rsquo;t think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras.</p>\n<p>I really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast.</p>\n<p>As I expected, it was a real pain to move the Pixel Watch from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google really does not understand what is a technology ecosystem<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, it&rsquo;s not just a suite of products that have the same appearance, it&rsquo;s products that work together with little effort by the user. The fact that one has to factory reset a WearOS watch to move it from one Pixel phone to another is the clearest evidence of Google&rsquo;s cluelessness when it comes to tech ecosystems. At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work.</p>\n<p>Of the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it&rsquo;s best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery. Seems to me though that Google intends users to keep the phone on the stand, so you would think they would incorporate programming to help with the battery health.</p>\n<p>Over all I am happy with the Pixel 7a. It&rsquo;s larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the &ldquo;A Series&rdquo; pixel phones, but it&rsquo;s not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the &ldquo;small, medium, and large&rdquo; sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phone is to get a larger screen. I really hope that Google keeps a phone that is no larger than 6-inches tall.</p>\n",

Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?</p>\n<p>Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited,&rdquo; 60Hz screen as my daily driver.

I am skeptical. I am thinking we are being convinced that faster smartphone refresh rates are needed, but they really are not.

Of course, I ran a speed test using the Pixel 7a as soon as I could and observed the fact that the 86 Mbps download feature is faster than the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; LTE transfer speed of my Pixel 4a. Ok, but in what way am I really going to notice or even need that faster transfer speed on a smartphone with a 6-inch screen? For example, I streamed video on the Pixel 7a and it looked no better to me than on the Pixel 4a.

Not only does Google require physically connecting the two phones together with a cable to transfer data, but to transfer a WearOS watch, like the Pixel Watch, from one phone to another you have to factory reset the watch. Seriously! Does anyone at Google ever even try moving from one generation phone to another?</p>\n<p>Google seems to think that when one buys a new Pixel phone they are going to buy a new watch too. The factory reset of the watch would not be so bad if one could restore the watch like one can with a Pixel phone, but Google does not provide a backup of WearOS watches to their cloud.</p>\n<p>Here is the process for one who owns a Pixel Watch paired with a Pixel 4a to replace the phone with a Pixel 7a. You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the &ldquo;old&rdquo; phone.</p>\n<p>Over the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets. Apple has been doing this for many years, and honestly, I do not understand why Google, with all of its technical brilliance cannot figure out how to make this process of transfering from one model Pixel phone to another as pain free as possible.</p>\n<p>So, once you have the phone set it comes time to pair the Pixel Watch to the new phone. The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything. Oh, and neither the Google Play store nor the Google Watch app keep track of what apps or watch faces you install on the watch, so you have figure out what to install! Anyone at Google who does such a transfer finds this acceptable ought to be embarrased, it might be the most brain dead process of all of technology!</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like nobody at Google has figured it out. Transferring the Pixel Buds Pro from the Pixel 4a to the 7a works exactly how one expects, and how transferring a watch should work.

Dave hosts an instance of pagePark that is integrated with Little Outliner such that as soon as an outline is saved, <a href=\"http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml\">the HTML version of that outline</a> is nearly instantly available.

I took the idea of the page redirect off my blog a step further by purchasing a domain, frankm.info, that I configured to forward to the site.

I&rsquo;ve used Drummer since its beginning and always knew that it would some day replace Little Outliner. I didn&rsquo;t move my informational outlines to Drummer until recently when Twitter made changes to its API that Dave has been using for user identity management and login. Dave announced he would be updating Drummer with a new login process and also move access of it to HTTPS.

It treated its employees more like people and less like human resources, giving them chances to learn and succeed along with the company. “I’m a great believer that in any team,” he told me, “any member is better at something than somebody else, so to get the team to perform you want everyone to perform on their best axis.

Using Reimer&rsquo;s comparison of ARM and Commodore, ARM was playing the infinite game, Commodore the finite game. In the book Sinek describes the reletively few businesses playing the &ldquo;infinite game&rdquo; versus the vast majority playing the &ldquo;finite&rdquo; game. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Infinite games have infinite time horizons. And because there is no finish line, no practical end to the game, there is no such thing as “winning” an infinite game. In an infinite game, the primary objective is to keep playing, to perpetuate the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having been hired by EDS and surviving through the multitude of transitions that has occurred, I have seen first hand the differences a building a company, which usually has a founder, and buying a company, which usually has a manager. In most cases bought companies are separated from their founding, has no leadership and thus no culture.</p>\n<p>It amazes me that given all the evidence of how to achieve long term success, such as ARM&rsquo;s, that so few U.S. companies are interested in the infinite game. The finite game rules business, thus it rules capitalism, and given relationship of capitalism to the United States, the finite game rules the U.S. I don&rsquo;t think prospects will change in the United States until we find leaders who are builders, right now our political, economic, and religions cultures appear to all be playing the finite game.</p>\n",

Ozzie Smith didn&rsquo;t make is his mark at the plate, he was known as the Wizard because of his defense. I always felt too much attention is paid to Baez&rsquo;s inconsistency at the plate and not enough value placed on his defense, which I think is worth enough to absorb his bat.</p>\n<p>Baez was not the problem in the Cubs lineup, the problem was that everyone else in the lineup was not much better. Put Baez in a lineup with other players who make contact and get on base and you can live with his strikeouts, and revel in his ability in the big moments. I think in some ways Baez is like Brett Farve, high risk and high reward. The defense, and in particular Reggie White, made Farve who he was for the Packers because it could overcome his interceptions. Put Farve on the Detroit Lions and he is not a hall of fame player.</p>\n<p>I am happy that even though Javier is no longer playing for the Cubs, he is playing for a team in my area that is on TV every day.

Ozzie Smith didn't make is his mark at the plate, he was known as the Wizard because of his defense. I always felt too much attention is paid to Baez's inconsistency at the plate and not enough value placed on his defense, which I think is worth enough to absorb his bat.\n\nBaez was not the problem in the Cubs lineup, the problem was that everyone else in the lineup was not much better. Put Baez in a lineup with other players who make contact and get on base and you can live with his strikeouts, and revel in his ability in the big moments. I think in some ways Baez is like Brett Farve, high risk and high reward. The defense, and in particular Reggie White, made Farve who he was for the Packers because it could overcome his interceptions. Put Farve on the Detroit Lions and he is not a hall of fame player. \n\nI am happy that even though Javier is no longer playing for the Cubs, he is playing for a team in my area that is on TV every day. Baez is the type of player you tune in just to watch, regardless of your interest in the team, much like Cabrera was in his prime. Tiger fans need to remember the incredible plays that he has already made in four games when he strikes out in that crticial moment in July because it will happen and he will still be worth every bit of money he is paid.\n",

What I really want is an application that acts for me like a switchboard where I can specific to which channels I want an item posted. I can post to micro.blog from eternal apps, but there is no API with Old School to enable the same. Those who read Dave should see some irony in this fact.\n",

I, of course, never met this man who had an impact on the direction of my life.</p>\n<p>My chosen field of study in college, computer science, led to the career that caused me to move to metropolitan Detroit, ultimately meet and marry my wife, and have the life I now live. How I came to chose to study computer science was influenced by three events during my high school years: the arrival of the Apple II in my high school, taking an after school BASIC programming class, and being gifted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000\">the Timex Sinclair 1000</a>.

				"content_text": "British inventor [Sir Clive Sinclair died yesterday, September 16](https://www.engadget.com/clive-sinclair-dead-obituary-212309487.html?src=rss&utm_source=pocket_mylist). I, of course, never met this man who had an impact on the direction of my life. \n\nMy chosen field of study in college, computer science, led to the career that caused me to move to metropolitan Detroit, ultimately meet and marry my wife, and have the life I now live. How I came to chose to study computer science was influenced by three events during my high school years: the arrival of the Apple II in my high school, taking an after school BASIC programming class, and being gifted [the Timex Sinclair 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timex_Sinclair_1000). Sir Sinclair invented the ZX80, the predecessor to the ZX8, in Britian, and that same computer was later sold as the Timex Sinclair 1000 in the United States.\n\nI was raised by my grandmother and we lived off social security along with some savings. The personal computers sold at the time cost well beyond our means, but the Timex Sinclair only cost $100, though you needed the nearly $40 additional cost of the 16 KB storage for it to be useful. The nearly $150 total cost made it the most expensive gift my grandmother ever bought me, and I don't doubt she made sacrifices to buy it, but she felt it important for my future. Turns out my grandmother was right.\n\nEven by the standards of the time, the Timex Sinclair was a bit of a joke for a computer. Frogger was one of the games available for the Timex Sinclair that my friend called \"woodtick\" because of how the large block pixel graphics of the frog took over the entire TV screen when it got run over by a car. \n\nBack then the common display for personal computers were TV screens. Programs were stored on cassete tapes. As I said, the Timex Sinclair only had 16 kilobytes of RAM. It had a membrane keyboard rather than a real keyboard that had most of the BASIC functions assigned. When writing a program you \"typed\" PRINT by pressing a combination of a function key and they key that had the command printed on it. I don't recall whether I ever connected the Timex Sinclair to a printer or did anything like word processing. \n\nDespite the limits Sinclair's invention made a brand new world of personal computing accessible to me in the comfort of my bedroom floor. Hours of typing in pre-printed programs from magazines and hours of experimenting with little BASIC programs sparked the interest that as I said led to the life I now have. \n\nReading [tributes and stories](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/sep/17/clive-sinclair-zx-spectrum-offbeat-brilliance?utm_source=pocket_mylist) of Sinclair, I know that I am just one of hundreds of thousands of people around the world that share the same story.

A stream is ephemeral, it continues to move over time and one mostly adds to it and watches it flow away. On the Internet a stream is content for only right now, and usually isn&rsquo;t edited nor looked at years later. Streams are date and time driven. Stream platforms are optimized for quick and easy entry of new content.</p>\n<p>Twitter, Facebook, and blogs are examples of platforms used for publishing streams of content. Note that this is not absolute, for example one can and might edit a blog post they wrote a year ago in which case that blog might well be a garden.</p>\n<p>The garden metaphor, in contrast, is more permanent. The content in a garden is continually edited to reflect new ideas or new learning over a period of time. A garden is organized around a topic. Platforms for creating and maintaining gardens are optimized for editing and linking together of content. Connecting the dots (linking) between content can generate new ideas or thoughts. Wiki is an example of a garden platform, as is the web itself as originally intended, as are other tools optimized for linking together and organizing content.</p>\n<p>A couple of other interesting differences exist between the two from a user and platform provider perspective.

The key point being the garden platform providers do not make money on the content. In my opinion, a site that has the purpose of making money from content is something other than a garden, so for example, I do not think of Medium as a garden, nor are other sites like The Verge or Engadget that may publish using a blogging or content management system.</p>\n",

Just about all the computer monitors we use support 60 Hz refresh rates.</p>\n<p>Now, I was using my Pixelbook with the dock and I found that when I connect it to the monitor using a USB-C cable it can do 4K@60Hz, so I figured the dock was the limiting factor, which I confirmed on the manufacture&rsquo;s web site.

When you connect the Pixelbook to a monitor with a USB-C cable it can use all four of the cable&rsquo;s communication lanes to enable it to handle 4K@60Hz.</p>\n<p>Anker&rsquo;s site says 4K on DisplayPort requires DisplayPort 1.4 and I have found that the Pixelbook only supports DisplayPort 1.2. As the article I found explains, DisplayPort 1.4 only needs two lanes for 4K@60Hz because it has an additional high bit rate mode and compression, which is why the Anker hub I have can do 4K@60Hz while also providing USB 3.1 data transfers. The problem is that the computer, hub, and monitor all need to support DisplayPort 1.4 for this all to work, and the Pixelbook does not.</p>\n<p>The lesson from this experience is that connecting to high resolution monitors at high refresh rates via a hub is more complicated than simply using a cable because it requires understanding the technical capabilities of the computer, hub, and monitor. You may have to dig to find out whether a computer, and a Chromebook in particular, supports DisplayPort 1.4. Thunderbolt 3 also supports 4K@60Hz and fast data transfers but is not yet available in Chromebooks and Thunderbolt 3 docks are more expensive than USB-C docks.</p>\n<p>I think my experience that I&rsquo;ve written about here explains why <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/05/06/chromebook-docking-stations/\">Google recently announced</a> the addition of docks to their &ldquo;Works With Chromebook&rdquo; program.

However, had I known what I now know prior to purchasing this Anker dock, I probably would have bought <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Multiport-DisplayPort-Ethernet/dp/B06Y5N3YCD/?tag=runworks-20\">this Cable Matters dock</a> instead as I could live with USB 2.1.

It really doesn't make sense to use the Pi 400 headless like I do my other Raspberry Pis. \n\nAll this is preamble to point you to [my retro computer](https://myretrocomputer.com/) that sells a case that looks nearly identical to the old C-64. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>It should be clear that Democrats need to work on their strategy for Presidential elections. If one is willing to listen to me, I have the following observations.</p>\n<p>Simply getting out the vote will not work. It seems the conclusion drawn from 2016 is that Clinton lost because not enough Democrats voted. The thinking is based on the belief there are more Democrats than Republicans in the United States. The problem is, increating vote count only works in a pure democratic nationwide election, aka the popular vote, and we don&rsquo;t elect Presidents in the United States by popular vote. (The founders feared a pure democracy.)</p>\n<p>Republicans have simplified the path to the White House: win rural votes by &gt; 50% margin and if you get 30% of the urban vote, you win, and that strategy aligns to the electoral college. In short, Democrats have to get more rural vote, which leads me to the one overriding fundamental that Democrats have to understand..</p>\n<p><strong>Fear of socialism trumps everything else!</strong></p>\n<p>People are not really voting on issues, which I think is why polling is not working. People are voting on fear and mostly fear of the other side. The Republican message is simple, Democrats are socialists, socialism = communism = evil = unAmercan, so vote Republican to save America!  A significant number of people are convinced they can never vote for a Democrat because that is a vote for Socialism. Add to that another significant number of people, call them evangelicals, who are convinced voting for a Demorat is a vote for killing babys and you have this result. And evangelials equate socialism to atheism which adds another reason why they fear Democrats. Then, sadly, add to the fact that there are too many who fear a vote for a Democrat is a vote for people of color over white people.</p>\n<p>If you consider that Republican votes are mostly all about fear of what Democrats will do, I think you see how the Democrat primary and compaigns of 2016 and 2020 make the election strategy for Republicans easy because policies considered to be socialist AND politicians considered to be socialists (Bernie Sanders) dominated the campaigns.</p>\n<p>In short, I think Bernie Sanders created a lot of fear among voters AND was a easy target. Even after Biden secured the nomination Republicans simply claimed Sanders would have significant influence over Biden because Democrats do want the Sanders followers support. I think this is true, hard to dispute and personally frustrating to me because Bernie is not even a Democrat!</p>\n<p>Why does this matter? It matters because for extremism to be successful it needs an equally extreme opposite. The antidote to extremism is the middle and unfortunately that is shrinking rapidly. I think the only way the middle, call them moderates, can be recovered is via a third party but how we finance and run elections in the United States in the 21st century really makes it impossible for a viable third party.</p>\n<p>In summary, fear of socialism trumps everything.

The Republicans will do everything and say everything to make sure Trump is not to blame. Only one Republican, Mitt Romney, appears willing to do what is right for the country rather than what is only right for themselves.</p>\n<p>Also, note, the problem here isn&rsquo;t really with Trump, it&rsquo;s with the people in the Republican party who enabled Trump to win their primary and be elected.

				"content_text": "One addition I would make to [the notes Dave wrote here](http://scripting.com/2020/03/16/200703.html?title=drivingNotes) is that Trump and his entire administration must be held accountable to the consequences of their decisions that caused the slow and ineffective response that resulted in loss of life and damage to the economy. The Republicans will do everything and say everything to make sure Trump is not to blame. Only one Republican, Mitt Romney, appears willing to do what is right for the country rather than what is only right for themselves. \n\nAlso, note, the problem here isn't really with Trump, it's with the people in the Republican party who enabled Trump to win their primary and be elected. Unless Republicans, starting with Republican Senators, start to publicly stand up against Trump and LEAD, they should all be held accountable. It's time for Republicans to decided whether or not they are true Americans and true patriots. I so wish John McCain were still alive! \n",

Let&rsquo;s say I plan to be on a long flight and I want to carry a minimal amount of gear. I can pack my iPad Pro, Raspberry Pi, and the Ravpower in my carry on and when I am able, power up the Pi, leave it in the carry on, and connect to it via WiFi from the iPad. At this point I can then SSH into the Pi and use a text editor (emacs, nano, etc..) to work on my code and test it using nodejs. Of course, you can do this for any other programming environments or compilers that install on the Raspberry Pi and run via the command prompt.

Was Solemani's killing done in the national interest or in Trump's self-interest? Did the President create serious instability for his own needs, possibly even in an effort to divert public attention from the impeachment.”\n\nPresident Trump lies and this is not even disputed by most of his supporters, they just claim he is no different than Obama or any other past president. So, given that we all accept that he lies, how can we trust anything he or his administration says? If we are to go back in to war again, should we not be sure it's for legitimate reasons?

				"title": "Comcast Data Cap Is Not High Enough",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://dataplan.xfinity.com/plans/\">Comcast&rsquo;s 1024 GB (1 TB) monthly data plan</a> (data cap) does not provide enough data for an increasing number of people. The main reason is that an increasing number of services, like Netflix, are streaming video at 4K quality, and in the case of Netflix, it default is to stream at the highest quality. Comcast and I fundamentally disagree, in that <a href=\"https://dataplan.xfinity.com/\">Comcast says few people will actually be affected</a> by the data cap.</p>\n<p>Last week I was shocked when I received an email notice from Comcast that we had consumed 90% of our 1024 data for the month. Why does Comcast default the notification to 90% rather than 50%? The higher data consumption appears to coincide with an automatic and &ldquo;free&rdquo; increase of our bandwidth to 100 Mbps last month. Comcast says an increase in bandwidth does not automatically lead to increase data usage, but given that Netflix, and I assume other apps, default to the highest quality video I suspect we ended up viewing more 4K video this month than we have in the past.</p>\n<p>Ever since receiving the email notification I have been closely monitoring our data usage, comparing network traffic stats to Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter, and I think the usage meter is accurate, unlike an issue that occurred in October where the meter was wrongly indicating drastically higher consumption. In general, I think Comcast&rsquo;s usage meter is insufficient in that it only shows a monthly total. If you have a cap and will automatically charge overages, I think you must at least provide daily stats. The worst part is that home owners don&rsquo;t have a good or easy to use tools of their own to confirm Comcast&rsquo;s data, leaving consumers at a disadvantage when trying to dispute Comcast&rsquo;s data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dataplan.xfinity.com/estimator/\">Comcast&rsquo;s Usage Estimate calculator</a> says a HD stream consumes 1.7 GB of data per hour, where as Netflix says that 1 hour of HD consumes 3 GB. Comcast and Netflix agree that one hour of 4K video consumes around 8 GB per hour. Using Netflix&rsquo;s rate that HD consumes 3 GB per hour, Comcast&rsquo;s claim that you can stream 21 GB per day of HD video is not correct.

				"content_text": "[Comcast's 1024 GB (1 TB) monthly data plan](https://dataplan.xfinity.com/plans/) (data cap) does not provide enough data for an increasing number of people. The main reason is that an increasing number of services, like Netflix, are streaming video at 4K quality, and in the case of Netflix, it default is to stream at the highest quality. Comcast and I fundamentally disagree, in that [Comcast says few people will actually be affected](https://dataplan.xfinity.com/) by the data cap. \n\nLast week I was shocked when I received an email notice from Comcast that we had consumed 90% of our 1024 data for the month. Why does Comcast default the notification to 90% rather than 50%? The higher data consumption appears to coincide with an automatic and \"free\" increase of our bandwidth to 100 Mbps last month. Comcast says an increase in bandwidth does not automatically lead to increase data usage, but given that Netflix, and I assume other apps, default to the highest quality video I suspect we ended up viewing more 4K video this month than we have in the past. \n\nEver since receiving the email notification I have been closely monitoring our data usage, comparing network traffic stats to Comcast's usage meter, and I think the usage meter is accurate, unlike an issue that occurred in October where the meter was wrongly indicating drastically higher consumption. In general, I think Comcast's usage meter is insufficient in that it only shows a monthly total. If you have a cap and will automatically charge overages, I think you must at least provide daily stats. The worst part is that home owners don't have a good or easy to use tools of their own to confirm Comcast's data, leaving consumers at a disadvantage when trying to dispute Comcast's data. \n\n[Comcast's Usage Estimate calculator](https://dataplan.xfinity.com/estimator/) says a HD stream consumes 1.7 GB of data per hour, where as Netflix says that 1 hour of HD consumes 3 GB. Comcast and Netflix agree that one hour of 4K video consumes around 8 GB per hour. Using Netflix's rate that HD consumes 3 GB per hour, Comcast's claim that you can stream 21 GB per day of HD video is not correct. At 3 GB per hour, that's 11 hours per day for 1024 GB per month. \n\nLast night I watched 1 hour of CW Seed on my Apple TV that consumed 6 GB of data, suggesting to me that stream is UHD quality rather than HD and I don't see a way to control the quality in the CW Seed app. \n\nIf you only have one video stream in a house, 11 hours is probably enough, but if you increase that to two streams, you are down to 5 hours per day per stream and that is not hard to exceed, particularly if you unknowingly watch some video in 4K. If you stream all video at 4K you can only watch a little over 4 hours per day, which is tight for one stream, and impossible for two. \n\nYou can control the quality of the video streams for some services, but you have to do so per application/service. For example, you can [configure Netflix to only stream at Standard quality](https://ipstarbroadband.com.au/support/how-to-reduce-netflix-data-usage/), but who wants to do that if they spent money on a HD TV? And, if you use more than one app, as many do with say Disney+ or Amazon Prime, you might not be able to change the video quality or you will have to spend a lot of time changing settings in indivdiual apps. And again... you spent good money on a high quality TV, you rightly expect to be able to see the best video!\n\n[Comcast does provide an unlimited plan](https://dataplan.xfinity.com/unlimited/) for an additional $50 per month. The current cap appears intended to drive more, if not most, home owners to pay that $50 more per month. (I personally don't do online gaming, but I bet that can consume a significant amount of data per month).

				"content_html": "<p>I have a hard time swallowing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17956202/google-pixel-3-price-expensive-why\">the $150 price increase</a> between the Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel 3. I know Google can set prices the market will bear, but when I look at the difference I ask myself is the price increase due to higher costs or a desire for a higher profit margin?</p>\n<p>Just about every Android phone that I have owned, from the original T-Mobile G1 to my current Pixel 2, has been either a Nexus or Made by Google phone because I value having the pure version of Android that is directly and quickly updated by Google. Having suffered during my Windows Mobile days of delayed software updates due to OEM timelines, I have tried to avoid such situations.</p>\n<p>I want to keep using Pixel phones, Google seems to want to be in the premium priced smartphone market. What can be done? Google can follow Apple&rsquo;s lead into that premium market by doing the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Continue to support older Pixel phones for several more future releases of Android. Google forced me to by a Pixel 2 because it announced Android 9 will not support the Nexus 6P, which I previously owned. In short Google should not continue only providing two operating system upgrades for their Pixel phones. The latest version of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-12/\">iOS supports five generations</a> of iPhones and Android needs to do the same for Pixel phones.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep selling at least two generations of Pixel phones and lower the price of the older generation. Right now the Pixel 2 is still available at the Google Store, but for how long?

				"content_text": "I have a hard time swallowing [the $150 price increase](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17956202/google-pixel-3-price-expensive-why) between the Google Pixel 2 and the Pixel 3. I know Google can set prices the market will bear, but when I look at the difference I ask myself is the price increase due to higher costs or a desire for a higher profit margin? \n\nJust about every Android phone that I have owned, from the original T-Mobile G1 to my current Pixel 2, has been either a Nexus or Made by Google phone because I value having the pure version of Android that is directly and quickly updated by Google. Having suffered during my Windows Mobile days of delayed software updates due to OEM timelines, I have tried to avoid such situations. \n\nI want to keep using Pixel phones, Google seems to want to be in the premium priced smartphone market. What can be done? Google can follow Apple's lead into that premium market by doing the following:\n\n1. Continue to support older Pixel phones for several more future releases of Android. Google forced me to by a Pixel 2 because it announced Android 9 will not support the Nexus 6P, which I previously owned. In short Google should not continue only providing two operating system upgrades for their Pixel phones. The latest version of [iOS supports five generations](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-12/) of iPhones and Android needs to do the same for Pixel phones.\n\n2. Keep selling at least two generations of Pixel phones and lower the price of the older generation. Right now the Pixel 2 is still available at the Google Store, but for how long? I think Google needs to keep selling the Pixel 2 until it announces the Pixel 4, which then builds in a lower priced Pixel. \n\nIt seems clear to me that smartphone prices have gone up across the board because Apple increased the price of the iPhone. I don't like the iPhone prices either, but there is one big difference today between iPhone and Pixel. The iPhone you buy today will very likely be able to run the version of iOS released four years from now, so you don't need to buy a new iPhone in two years, you cannot say the same thing about Pixel.\n\nThe combination of the $150 price increase, Apple's practice to support older models of iPhones and selling older models at lower prices has me considering for the first time a switch to iPhone.
