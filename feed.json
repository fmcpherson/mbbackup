The fact that the 2024 team&rsquo;s starting pitching has been so good is as much an indicator of how much MLB has changed since 2016 than anything.

It is ESSENTIAL to such a government that it be derived from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable proportion, or a favored class of it; otherwise a handful of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of republicans, and claim for their government the honorable title of republic.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The founders knew how emoluments could lead to corruption<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because they lived in a time when it was common practice for foreign countries to gain favor from monarchs by gift giving.

Originalists will say, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 only has the words &ldquo;from any King, Prince, or foreign State&rdquo; and there is no such prohibition of emoluments given from citizens of the United States, even if the very thing that clause was intended to prevent, which is the corruption of the government through quid pro quo, is what is happening.</p>",

However, I don't know how anyone can deny that huge part of our lack of trust in the institutions of government, or media (journalism), or medicine, is due in large part to an awareness of how much influence on decisions is being bought. The growing lack of trust in government is the corrosion (<a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=corruption\">corruption</a>) of the Republic in plain sight. (Further, if you think about it, much of the lack of trust in Biden or Trump is due to money!)\n\nThe founders of the United States knew full well the affect emoluments can have on a <a href=\"https://mises.org/mises-wire/stop-saying-were-republic-not-democracy?gad_source=1\">republic</a>, which is why they included <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11086#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20Domestic,to%20exert%20influence%20over%20him.\">clauses in the Constitution</a> to limit that affect. Unfortunately, the ideology of originalism says that literal words, not the meaning or intent, only matters. (Taken to its logical conclusion, originalism can mean that Supreme Court Justices could be replaced by AI.)  Originalists will say, Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 only has the words \"from any King, Prince, or foreign State\" and there is no such prohibition of emoluments given from citizens of the United States, even if the very thing that clause was intended to prevent, which is the corruption of the government through quid pro quo, is what is happening.\n",
