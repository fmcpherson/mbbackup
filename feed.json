The MLB season is a marathon meaning that in most cases a game is not treated as &ldquo;must win.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Oddly, while a long schedule means most games are not &ldquo;must win,&rdquo; for some teams, earlier than they would like, the season transitions to &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether they win or lose&rdquo; because they are out of playoff contention. As a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan it has been my experience more often than not that the Cubs are out of playoff contention by the end of May or early June. Further, as a lifelong Cubs fan, I have learned it is much more fun watching games year after year when the team is playing meaningful games in September. I would much rather have the team lose in the playoffs every year than have the team out the playoffs by June in the majority of seasons.</p>\n\n<p>So, in baseball, a transition occurs over the course of a season where teams move from playing to win games to playing to must win games. The benefit of expanding the number of playoff teams is that more teams start playing more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games in September than in years past. In my experience, teams with players who have the most experience winning &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games are best positioned for long term success.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, it should be obvious why wild card teams, which have worse records than division winners, have had so much success in the playoffs, it&rsquo;s because they usually play more &ldquo;must win&rdquo; games during the last month of the season and through that gain valuable experience and confidence. Turns out there is a big difference between &ldquo;wanting to win&rdquo; and &ldquo;needing to win.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>At this point of a long 2023 season, the Chicago Cubs are starting the transition in to &ldquo;must win&rdquo; territory. Nobody associated with the Cubs is going to admit publicly that the games they are playing this week and next are must win, but it&rsquo;s a mistake if they don&rsquo;t start viewing the games as such, in fact they ought to embrace the transition. As Billy Jean King is often <a href=\"https://www.azquotes.com/quote/621788\">quoted as saying</a>, &ldquo;Pressure is a privilege.&rdquo; The pressure of being in &ldquo;must win&rdquo; mode as the calendar flips from August to September is a badge of success.</p>\n\n<p>The unpredictable nature of sports mean should the Cubs make the playoffs they could win the World Series. The probability of the 2023 Cubs winning the World Series is not high, not like it was for the 2016 team.

Case in point is micro.blog, which appears to aspire to nothing more than nurturing a relatively small community and yet I assume it generates enough revenue to cover costs and provides enough income for it's employees. The ideas of \"enough\" and \"nurturing\" are what is missing behind nearly all of the alternatives except for perhaps Mastodon, which appears to be dedicated to nurturing an open source alternative.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Google announced and began selling <a href=\"https://store.google.com/product/pixel_7a?hl=en-US\">the Pixel 7a</a> earlier last month, and I ordered a Sea colored version from Amazon about a week later. The Pixel 7a is replacing the Pixel 4a that has been my everyday carry phone for the last three years. I really like the size and feel of the Pixel 4a and so I was not eager to up-size to the newer phone, but it has come to the end of the road with Android and there are features the 7a has that make the upgrade a &ldquo;no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>My main concern about the Pixel 7a has been its size and glossy back. The Pixel 7a is taller than the Pixel 4a and because of that I find it harder to operate with one hand. The weight, however, is the most noticeable difference. I am finding that due to the weight it is more comfortable holding the phone in my left hand, but in a position where I can&rsquo;t scroll apps with that same hand and as a result this phone requires more two hand operation than the Pixel 4a. The weight and size difference is also noticeable when I put the Pixel 7a in a front pant pocket. Fortunately, the size do not make these use cases impossible, just different and I suspect the difference will become less noticeable over time.</p>\n\n<p>The back of the Pixel 7a is more &ldquo;polished&rdquo; than the Pixel 4a, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel so slippery that I fear it is going to quickly slip out of my hand. I purchased a <a href=\"https://latercase.com/products/google-pixel-7a-thin-case?variant=40235135729750\">really nice Latercase</a> that does not add much weight or bulk and gives a more matte like feel to the back of the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life appears to be better, but I don&rsquo;t know whether that is simply because the battery is larger or the Google Tensor G2 is that much more efficient. <a href=\"https://accubatteryapp.com/\">Accubattery</a> is showing that screen of battery consumption is at 2% or less, which is definitely better than the Pixel 4a that is closer to 3%. Battery life is an item that requires a longer duration to evaluate.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it is just me, but I think pictures using the wide angle lens have a bit of a fish eye affect. (See the last picture on <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/20/testing-the-camera.html\">this page</a> for an example.) I don&rsquo;t think the camera app clearly indicates how to switch between cameras.</p>\n\n<p>I really like the under screen fingerprint scanner, although that may be more due to the fact that scanner is on the front of the phone rather than on the back. Now I know exactly where to put my finger and therefore the scanner works more accurately. The face unlock also works ok, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to trigger fast enough. People complain about the speed of the finger print scanner, but I find it plenty fast.</p>\n\n<p>As I expected, it was a real pain to move the Pixel Watch from the Pixel 4a to the 7a. <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/2023/05/21/googles-tech-ecosystem.html\">Google really does not understand what is a technology ecosystem</a>, it&rsquo;s not just a suite of products that have the same appearance, it&rsquo;s products that work together with little effort by the user. The fact that one has to factory reset a WearOS watch to move it from one Pixel phone to another is the clearest evidence of Google&rsquo;s cluelessness when it comes to tech ecosystems. At least the Pixel Buds were automatically recognized and work.</p>\n\n<p>Of the new features I get with the Pixel 7a, I like the wireless charging the best, although I am still working on how often to do the charging. I bought the Pixel Stand and have it on my desk where I could put my phone during the work day, but what is the impact on battery health from keeping the phone on the charger for extended periods of time? Articles on lithium batteries say it&rsquo;s best to keep the phones between 20% to 80% charged given that each full cycle has an impact on the life time of the battery. Seems to me though that Google intends users to keep the phone on the stand, so you would think they would incorporate programming to help with the battery health.</p>\n\n<p>Over all I am happy with the Pixel 7a. It&rsquo;s larger than the Pixel 4a but it is the smallest Pixel, and I definitely think it is better to buy it than the cheaper and older Pixel 6a. Rumor is that the 7a may be the last of the &ldquo;A Series&rdquo; pixel phones, but it&rsquo;s not clear exactly what that means. It could mean that Google will stop staggering the release of phones in the spring/summer and fall/winter like they have over the last several years but keep the &ldquo;small, medium, and large&rdquo; sizes, or it could be they drop the phone all together. Given that the Pixel 7a has nearly all the same specs as the Pixel 7, it seems the only reason one would buy the &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phone is to get a larger screen. I really hope that Google keeps a phone that is no larger than 6-inches tall.</p>\n",

Do we, really, need smartphone screens faster than 60Hz?</p>\n\n<p>Up until last week I have been using the Pixel 4a, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;limited,&rdquo; 60Hz screen as my daily driver.

				"title": "Google's Tech Ecosystem Failure",
				"content_html": "<p>I have now replaced two Pixel phones with a newer model and each time I do I am astounded by how little Google understands technology ecosystems. Not only does Google require physically connecting the two phones together with a cable to transfer data, but to transfer a WearOS watch, like the Pixel Watch, from one phone to another you have to factory reset the watch. Seriously! Does anyone at Google ever even try moving from one generation phone to another?</p>\n\n<p>Google seems to think that when one buys a new Pixel phone they are going to buy a new watch too. The factory reset of the watch would not be so bad if one could restore the watch like one can with a Pixel phone, but Google does not provide a backup of WearOS watches to their cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the process for one who owns a Pixel Watch paired with a Pixel 4a to replace the phone with a Pixel 7a. You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the &ldquo;old&rdquo; phone.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets. Apple has been doing this for many years, and honestly, I do not understand why Google, with all of its technical brilliance cannot figure out how to make this process of transfering from one model Pixel phone to another as pain free as possible.</p>\n\n<p>So, once you have the phone set it comes time to pair the Pixel Watch to the new phone. The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything. Oh, and neither the Google Play store nor the Google Watch app keep track of what apps or watch faces you install on the watch, so you have figure out what to install! Anyone at Google who does such a transfer finds this acceptable ought to be embarrased, it might be the most brain dead process of all of technology!</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not like nobody at Google has figured it out. Transferring the Pixel Buds Pro from the Pixel 4a to the 7a works exactly how one expects, and how transferring a watch should work. No reset, no pairing, no manual configuration, just take the buds out of the case, put them in my ear, and they just work on the new phone!</p>\n\n<p>Like the Pixel Buds, the Pixel Watch is an accessory to Pixel Phones, but the WearOS, Android, and Pixel teams seem to think the Pixel Watch is a standalone device. Sure, one can buy a watch with an LTE radio and with it and the built-in GPS the watch can function apart from the phone, but honestly, most users are not buying watches with LTE radios. Even if they do, the process of using the Play Store app on the watch to find and install apps is best described as tedious.</p>\n\n<p>The worst part of the WearOS apps process is that Google actually had it right the first time it released their smartwatch operating system. When Google first released a smartwatch there was no way to install apps directly on the watch, you had to use the phone, and the companion app on the phone made it easy to manage the apps to install. Back then while recovering from a factory reset did not automatically restore the watch, it at least put all the apps you had installed in one spot so that you could manually trigger the installation.</p>\n\n<p>For all the progress Google has made over the years to improve Android, Pixel phones, and develop the Pixel Watch, the lack of emphasis on making the products work together seamlessly is a huge let down. Given there have been now been several iterations of Android, WearOS, and Pixel phones, there is no excuse for why the transfer process so brain dead. What I see is a lack of diligence and a willingness to accept things that are not good enough, and I have to question whether such a company unwilling to do things right ought to be trusted playing with technology such as Artificial Intelligence that could be dangerous.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "I have now replaced two Pixel phones with a newer model and each time I do I am astounded by how little Google understands technology ecosystems. Not only does Google require physically connecting the two phones together with a cable to transfer data, but to transfer a WearOS watch, like the Pixel Watch, from one phone to another you have to factory reset the watch. Seriously! Does anyone at Google ever even try moving from one generation phone to another? \n\nGoogle seems to think that when one buys a new Pixel phone they are going to buy a new watch too. The factory reset of the watch would not be so bad if one could restore the watch like one can with a Pixel phone, but Google does not provide a backup of WearOS watches to their cloud. \n\nHere is the process for one who owns a Pixel Watch paired with a Pixel 4a to replace the phone with a Pixel 7a. You transfer the SIM from the old phone to the new, then connect a USB-C cable between the 4a and the 7a to transfer your phone settings (ring tones, etc..) and SMS messages. During the transfer the icons for your apps are added to the new phone, but then all of the apps have to be installed. In many cases app settings, particularly logins, do not transfer, so after the apps install you spend a considerable amount of time going through each app to be sure it works as on the \"old\" phone. \n\nOver the years I have replaced several iPads with newer models and never once have I ever had to physically connect a cable to move settings and apps between the tablets. Apple has been doing this for many years, and honestly, I do not understand why Google, with all of its technical brilliance cannot figure out how to make this process of transfering from one model Pixel phone to another as pain free as possible. \n\nSo, once you have the phone set it comes time to pair the Pixel Watch to the new phone. The process requires doing a factory reset of the watch as if you just took it out of the box, and worse, after you pair it with the new phone there is no transfer of app icons, settings, or anything. Oh, and neither the Google Play store nor the Google Watch app keep track of what apps or watch faces you install on the watch, so you have figure out what to install! Anyone at Google who does such a transfer finds this acceptable ought to be embarrased, it might be the most brain dead process of all of technology! \n\nIt's not like nobody at Google has figured it out. Transferring the Pixel Buds Pro from the Pixel 4a to the 7a works exactly how one expects, and how transferring a watch should work. No reset, no pairing, no manual configuration, just take the buds out of the case, put them in my ear, and they just work on the new phone! \n\nLike the Pixel Buds, the Pixel Watch is an accessory to Pixel Phones, but the WearOS, Android, and Pixel teams seem to think the Pixel Watch is a standalone device. Sure, one can buy a watch with an LTE radio and with it and the built-in GPS the watch can function apart from the phone, but honestly, most users are not buying watches with LTE radios. Even if they do, the process of using the Play Store app on the watch to find and install apps is best described as tedious. \n\nThe worst part of the WearOS apps process is that Google actually had it right the first time it released their smartwatch operating system. When Google first released a smartwatch there was no way to install apps directly on the watch, you had to use the phone, and the companion app on the phone made it easy to manage the apps to install. Back then while recovering from a factory reset did not automatically restore the watch, it at least put all the apps you had installed in one spot so that you could manually trigger the installation. \n\nFor all the progress Google has made over the years to improve Android, Pixel phones, and develop the Pixel Watch, the lack of emphasis on making the products work together seamlessly is a huge let down. Given there have been now been several iterations of Android, WearOS, and Pixel phones, there is no excuse for why the transfer process so brain dead. What I see is a lack of diligence and a willingness to accept things that are not good enough, and I have to question whether such a company unwilling to do things right ought to be trusted playing with technology such as Artificial Intelligence that could be dangerous.\n",

I couldn't even get Google Assistant to display the video I want. some reason why I asked it to display a video from YouTube it wants to cast it to my TV rather than on the display itself! \r\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In 2015 <a href=\"https://sive.rs/nowff\">Derek Sivers proposed the idea</a> of sharing one&rsquo;s status by creating a /now page off of one&rsquo;s web site. The intent of the page is simply sharing what one is doing. <a href=\"https://nownownow.com/\">The idea caught on</a> and today many sites, some more current than others, have a now page.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to create and maintain my /now page using Dave Winer&rsquo;s Little Outliner because I felt it was a good editor for this type of writing, and it worked particularly well with another piece of software by Dave called pagePark. <a href=\"https://github.com/scripting/pagePark\">PagePark</a> is a HTTP server that renders the OPML files that Little Outliner creates into HTML. Dave hosts an instance of pagePark that is integrated with Little Outliner such that as soon as an outline is saved, <a href=\"http://my.this.how/frankm/whatIsFrankDoing.opml\">the HTML version of that outline</a> is nearly instantly available. Consequently, the process of editing and publishing changes to my /now page was as simple and quick as loading Little Outliner and writing. Low friction increases the possibility of keeping the page current.</p>\n\n<p>Connecting my /now page to my blog was straightforward because the hosting provider makes it easy to create pages that redirect to other pages. Therefore, when you type <a href=\"https://frankmcpherson.blog/now\">https://frankmcpherson.blog/now</a> you end up at my /now page. I took the idea of the page redirect off my blog a step further by purchasing a domain, frankm.info, that I configured to forward to the site. If anyone asked me online, what am I doing, I can tell them to simply go to <a href=\"http://frankm.info\">frankm.info</a> to find out.</p>\n\n<p>Over time I expanded beyond the single /now page to add pages that listed <a href=\"http://tech.frankm.info\">the technology that I use</a> and the <a href=\"http://2022books.frankm.info\">books that I have read</a>, each with their own alias URL. Using a forwarding URL enables me to move the actual location of the files, update the forwarding destination in DNS, and instances of the alias URL that I have in my writing will point to the current location.</p>\n\n<p>Since the time that I set all this up using Little Outliner, Dave created a new &ldquo;version&rdquo; of it called <a href=\"https://drummer.land\">Drummer</a>. I&rsquo;ve used Drummer since its beginning and always knew that it would some day replace Little Outliner. I didn&rsquo;t move my informational outlines to Drummer until recently when Twitter made changes to its API that Dave has been using for user identity management and login. Dave announced he would be updating Drummer with a new login process and also move access of it to HTTPS. He stated he did not intend to make changes to Little Outliner, and advised anyone using it to move to Drummer as soon as possible, and at that time I migrated my files over so that I can edit them in Drummer, and I updated the alias URLs accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Dave had to make the changes quickly because Twitter had not stated a clear deadline by which it would cut off access to its API, and that means prioritizing what he works on first. For example, the blogging capability Drummer provides currently does not work. I am sure that capability will be restored, and Dave will get to it when he gets to it. The &ldquo;publishing&rdquo; of OPML files via an instance of pagePark is also lower on the list. Consequently, I started thinking about what I can do to restore my ability to publish updates to my /now page.</p>\n\n<p>One option was to stop using Drummer to edit these pages, but that would create a lot of work moving the content and formattting it. The option that I took was to build my own instance of pagePark. First I tried using <a href=\"https://pagepark.onrender.com\">an instance of pagePark</a> that I built under a free account at <a href=\"https://render.com\">Render</a>. Render only allows HTTPS access and the free account takes the site offline after 30 minutes. When you request the site, it&rsquo;s brought online but there is a noticable delay. Consequently, I built a new virtual machine using free resources provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve updated <a href=\"http://projects.frankm.info\">my projects outline</a> with the details about how I set this up, it was pretty straightforward after I figured out how to get around firewall issues.

Here is a quote from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/a-history-of-arm-part-3-coming-full-circle/\">the end of the series</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the key to Saxby’s management approach was simple yet uncommon in the business world: ARM grew because it helped others grow. It treated its employees more like people and less like human resources, giving them chances to learn and succeed along with the company. “I’m a great believer that in any team,” he told me, “any member is better at something than somebody else, so to get the team to perform you want everyone to perform on their best axis. Teams that work well together work better.” He emphasized the importance of being honest with employees and not overpromising what the company had to offer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above resonates with me because the company I hired in to out of college, Electronic Data Systems, had the same business model, treat employees in a similar manner, and had success. Unlike ARM, EDS went through several different owners (GM, HP, HPE, CSC/DXC) and CEOs and each change moved further from the founding vision to the point at which it no-longer really exists.</p>\n\n<p>The story also calls to mind <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780735213524\">The Infinite Game</a> by Steve Sinek. Using Reimer&rsquo;s comparison of ARM and Commodore, ARM was playing the infinite game, Commodore the finite game. In the book Sinek describes the reletively few businesses playing the &ldquo;infinite game&rdquo; versus the vast majority playing the &ldquo;finite&rdquo; game. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Infinite games have infinite time horizons. And because there is no finish line, no practical end to the game, there is no such thing as “winning” an infinite game. In an infinite game, the primary objective is to keep playing, to perpetuate the game.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having been hired by EDS and surviving through the multitude of transitions that has occurred, I have seen first hand the differences a building a company, which usually has a founder, and buying a company, which usually has a manager. In most cases bought companies are separated from their founding, has no leadership and thus no culture.</p>\n\n<p>It amazes me that given all the evidence of how to achieve long term success, such as ARM&rsquo;s, that so few U.S. companies are interested in the infinite game. The finite game rules business, thus it rules capitalism, and given relationship of capitalism to the United States, the finite game rules the U.S. I don&rsquo;t think prospects will change in the United States until we find leaders who are builders, right now our political, economic, and religions cultures appear to all be playing the finite game.</p>\n",

I moved the item link to below the item content, but my temporary work around is to configure the applet to create a \"default\" title for every post, with the actual title, it it exists, on the following line. but this is not optimal.\r\n\r\nIt looks like I could add some Javascript logic to the applet so I am wondering if I could simply write some code to inspect the feed title and skip it, but that may take some time to figure it out. I wonder whether anyone else has already done this? \n",

I am expecting Twitter to get worse under Musk.\n\nI understand lots of journalism and media types use Twitter, but if it becomes a private social platform under the control of an oligarch, is that the right place to be doing journalism? Once private Twitter should cease to be a source for any news. \n",

Rapid tests won't detect all cases, so they don't guarantee one is not infected, BUT if a rapid test is positive you then clearly know you are a threat to spreading the infection to others and should definitely stay home, which is more information than the average person has before they walk out the door.\n",
